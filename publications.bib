	abstract = {Slippage” of attention in time and space has been studied separately, using visual search (e.g., Snyder, 1972) and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) (e.g., McLean, Broadbent, \& Broadbent, 1982). The primary purpose of the current study was to see if we could replicate these findings of slippage and if we did, to use individual differences to explore relationships between slippage in the temporal and spatial domains. The participants identified and localized targets in visual search and in RSVP sequences. In Experiment 1, we used visual search and RSVP tasks closely replicating the methods of Snyder and McLean et al. In Experiment 2, we closely equated the two tasks as far as possible while maintaining the crucial space/time difference. Consistent with the previous studies, and reflecting binding errors (or slippage) in both space and time, erroneously reported identities were predominantly from items adjacent to the targets. Correlations between measures of the slippage in space (visual search) and time (RSVP) were near zero, suggesting that different attentional ‘beams’ bind features in space and time, a possibility that is consistent with other behavioural as well as neuropsychological evidence.},

	abstract = {The present study investigated whether we deliberately or reﬂexively attend to where others are looking. Past research was conﬂicted on this issue because other people’s faces shift our attention rapidly in a reﬂex-like manner, but faces can also prompt a deliberate shift of our attention, like choosing to follow an arrow indicating a route. By putting schematic faces into two experiments distinguishing deliberate and reﬂexive attention, we showed that both modes of attention can be activated by faces: We reﬂexively and deliberately attend where others are looking.},
