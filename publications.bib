We explored the generality of this effect by using paintings in which the gaze direction of a key character had been carefully manipulated. Our observers looked at these paintings in one of three instructional states (neutral, social, or spatial) while we monitored their eye movements. Overt orienting was much less influenced by the critical gaze direction than what the cuing literature might suggest: An analysis of the direction of saccades following the first fixation of the critical gaze showed that observers were weakly biased to orient in the direction of the gaze. Over longer periods of viewing, however, this effect disappeared for all but the social condition. This restriction of gaze as an attentional cue to a social context is consistent with the idea that the evolution of gaze direction detection is rooted in social communication.

*************************
STUDY SUMMARY
*************************
Study Question:Can we produce IOR in gaze-cuing?
Study Result: No.
Hypothesis: If attention is oriented back to fixation following an uninformative gaze cue, then IOR will be observed.
Procedure Summary: Past research in gaze-cueing has shown that you cannot produce IOR with gaze-cuing. Posner \& Cohen (1984) showed that if attention remains at the cued location, you do not get an IOR effect. So, this study hypothesized that if gaze-cuing is such that people keep their attention oriented to the cued location, then cuing attention back to fixation should produce an IOR effect for the area originally cued.
There were two experiments: 1a and 1b.
1a used SOAs of 180, 360, 720, and 1440ms. Participants in 1a did the experiment individually, each in separate rooms.
1b used SOAs of 180, 720, 1440, and 2880ms. Participants in 1b did the experiment in groups of 2, all in the same room.
Conditions were as follows: All cues were uninformative.


Gaze Back: Participants are cued to shift their attention, and then the cue shifts back to centre, causing attention to re-orient to centre.


No Return: Participants are cued, and the gaze cue remains looking in the same direction through the remainder of the trial.


Cue Back: Participants are cued, and then the gaze cue outline brightens to exogenously cue people to return their attention to fixation.


If it is true that gaze-cuing causes attention to remain oriented in place and that is why it doesn't show IOR, then the Gaze Back and Cue Back conditions should show IOR. This should be obvious at longer SOAs.
Results Summary: No IOR observed in any of the three conditions. Gaze-cuing did provide facilitation at early SOAs, but no IOR.
Discussion Summary: It is an open question whether gaze-cuing is more like endogenous or exogenous orienting. It simply could be a hybrid.
There are two main reasons to believe it may be more like exogenous orienting:


Orienting to gaze is rapid when in response to uninformative, peripheral cues.


When gaze is given a counter-predictive meaning, the initial attention shift is in the direction of the gaze. Therefore, the initial response to a gaze cue is reflexive.


There are three main reasons to believe it may be more like endogenous orienting:


Gaze cues are rarely followed by IOR, unlike exogenous cues which are always followed by IOR.


Like centrally presented, informative cues, central gaze cues do not directly stimulate the periphery.


Vecera \& Rizzo (2006) had a frontal patient who failed to orient to gaze cues while still orienting normally to exogenous cues. The patient also failed to orient to central cues, which indicates that gaze-cuing shares control mechanisms with both endogenous and exogenous orienting.


Future Directions
We must figure out whether gaze-cuing is more like endogenous or exogenous orienting.
Klein (1994) showed that endogenous attention interacts with nonspatial expectancies, whereas exogenous attention is additive with nonspatial expectancies.
Briand \& Klein (1987) showed that endogenous attention is additive with opportunities for illusory conjunctions, whereas exogenous attention interacts with opportunities for illusory conjunctions.
Gaze cuing must be combined with the methods of Klein (1994) and Briand \& Klein (1987).
If gaze cuing is interactive with nonspatial expectancies and additive with opportunities for illusory conjunctions, then we can conclude that gaze cuing is more like endogenous attention.
If gaze cuing is additive with nonspatial expectancies and interactive with opportunities for illusory conjunctions, then gaze cuing is more like exogenous attention.

*************************
CLARIFICATION NOTES
**************************
Posner Cueing Paradigm: Explanation from Wikipedia


Cues:


Endogenous cues: Presented at centre


Exogenous cues: Presented peripherally




Valid, Invalid, and Neutral trials:


Valid: Stimulus appears on side indicated by cue


Invalid: Stimulus appears on side opposite to that indicated by cue


Neutral: No cues, just stimulus


Or, less commonly, cues that alert the participant that a stimulus is coming, but don't tell which side


E.g., Double-sided arrow






Posner used 80\% valid, 20\% invalid in his experiments to get participants used to following the cue




Informative and Uninformative cueing:


Informative cues occur when the ratio of Valid/Invalid trials is such that Valid trials are more likely (typically, this is 75/25 or 80/20, the latter being Posner's favourite).


Uninformative cues occur when the ratio of Valid/Invalid trials is set so that the type of trial is random (so, 50/50).




Stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs):


Time interval between onset of cue and onset of target.




**************************
INTRODUCTION
**************************


Uninformative peripheral cues can cause rapid automatic orienting at short SOAs, such that targets presented near the stimulated location are processed more efficiently than farther away ones.


Gaze cueing first started as a study in joint attention in infants.


Infants as young as 6mos can look faster at a target that was gaze cued.


Question: Did the gaze cue orient attention, or did it activate an oculomotor program to look in the same direction? Either way, orienting was enhanced.




Friesen \& Kingstone (1998): First gaze cueing orienting study in adults.


Reflexive orienting is triggered by a nonpredictive gaze.


At early SOAs, there was a reliable facilitation from gaze cues.


Did not find IOR at long SOAs. This is strange.




Why doesn't gaze cueing show IOR?


Posner \& Cohen (1984): If attention remains at a cued location, we don't see IOR.


So, they drew attention back to centre with two methods:


Face brightens (exogenous).


Targets were more likely at fixation than at two peripheral locations (endogenous).




It could be that after an uninformative gaze cue, attention stays at the cued location rather than returning to neutral.






If gaze cueing is exogenously controlled, then we should expect that attention would remain oriented at the cued location, given that the eyes keep gazing in that direction. This could prevent IOR.


 
Current Study


Uninformative gaze cues presented at various intervals prior to target presentation.


To replicate finding of orienting to gaze cues.




Three conditions:


Two conditions: Return attention to fixation.


Gaze Back: Gaze returned to centre.


Cue Back: Brightness of face cues return to fixation.




One condition:Do not return attention to fixation. 


No Return: Maintain attention at cued location using face that continues to gaze in cued direction for duration of trial.






Hypotheses:


Gaze Back and Cue Back conditions should show IOR, No Return condition should not show IOR.




Special methods:


Nonspatial discrimination task (A kind of Choice task): Two-choice response (Is triangle pointing up or down?)


This avoids possibility that RT differences between cued and uncued targets are due to response bias (which happens w/detection tasks) or cue-induced response activation (which happens w/localization tasks).


Also enables us to see if gaze cueing interacts w/the Simon effect.






**************************
METHOD
**************************
Procedure


Fig. 2:







Experiment 1a: Administered individually. Each person completes experiment alone in a room.


Intervals: 90, 270, 630, 1350ms


Written as SOAs: 180, 360, 720, 1440ms






Experiment 1b: Administered in groups of 20 students in one room.


Intervals: 90, 630, 1350, 2790ms


Written as SOAs: 180, 720, 1440, 2880ms






Face/Target remains on screen for 1500ms or until participant responds


Valid/Invalid: 50/50. Therefore, gaze cues are entirely uninformative.


Participant task: Indicate orienrtation of target shape using number keys ("1" for upward pointing triangle, "2" for downward).


Participants told to fixate on nose of face at all times.


Participants told that direction of gaze was uninformative and that two types of triangles were equally likely to appear.


**************************
RESULTS
**************************
Experiment 1a


No main effect of Return condition.


Main effects of SOAs: Longer RTs for shortest interval than the others.


Main effect of Cue condition: Faster RTs to validly cued targets.


Main effect of Simon congruency: Faster RTs when target and response were on same side.


Interaction between Cue Condition and Simon congruency: Larger Simon effect at uncued location.


Marginal interaction between Cue Condition and Return Condition.


Accuracy:


Significant effect of Simon congruency (more accurate when target was on same side).


Significant interaction between Cue condition and Simon congruency.


Fig. 4:





From most accurate to least accurate, and from fastest to slowest RT:


Valid cue, Incongruent Simon trial.


Invalid cue, Incongruent Simon trial.


Valid cue, Congruent Simon trial.


Invalid cue, Congruent Simon trial.












Experiment 1b


No main effect of Return condition.


Main effect of SOAs: Longer RTs for shortest interval than the others.


Main effect of Cue condition: Faster RT to validly cued targets.


Main effect of Simon congruency: Faster RTs when target and response were on same side.


Interaction between Cue condition and Simon congruency: Larger Simon effect at uncued location.


Accuracy:


Significant effect of SOA: Less accurate at shortest interval.


Significant effect of Simon congruency: Less accurate response when target and response were on opposite sides.


Main effect of Cue condition: Accuracy slightly higher on valid than on invalid trials.




Combined analyses


Participants in Experiment 1b were significantly faster than those in 1a, and were non-significantly less accurate by 9\% (when compared across common SOAs).


Attributable to Experiment 1b being put in a group, therefore being more competitive.




**************************
DISCUSSION
**************************


No significant differences in patterns of results for common SOAs of the two experiments, so it doesn't matter if you use a group or individualized administration. Justifies collapsing the two experiments for the purposes of power.


Significant facilitation from uninformative gaze cues at SOAs up to 1440ms.


No significant IOR detected at any SOA.


Facilitation from gaze cues interacted with Simon effect (target/response location congruity) such that Simon effect was significantly reduced at cued location.


Timecourse of Gaze Cuing


No IOR for gaze cuing.


If we look at the time course in Fig. 1, exogenous orienting shows pretty clear IOR at longer SOAs, whereas orienting to uninformative gaze cues does not show any IOR at all. The time course is radically different.


Is Gaze-Directed Attention More Like Endogenous or Exogenous Attention?


Case for exogenous:


In response to an uninformative, peripherally presented cue, orienting to gaze is rapid.


Even when gaze is given a counter-predictive meaning (gaze left signals right handed target), initial attention shift is in the direction of the gaze, so the initial response is reflexive.




Case for endogenous:


Gaze cues are rarely followed by IOR, unlike exogenous cues.


Like centrally presented, informative cues, central gaze cues do not directly stimulate the periphery.


Vecera \& Rizzo (2006): Frontal patient who failed to orient to gaze cues while still orienting normally to exogenous cues. Patient also failed to orient to central cues, indicating gaze cuing shares endogenous control mechanisms.




Gaze Cuing and the Simon Effect


Gaze cuing is distinguished from typical exo and endo controlled shifts of attention.


The pattern of interaction seen in Fig. 4 is different from typical exo and endo shifts.




**************************
CONCLUSION
**************************


Whether gaze is endo or exo must be further explored.


Recommended studies:


Differences between endo and exo: Klein \& Shore (2000); Klein (2004).


E.g. Endogenous attention interacts with nonspatial expectancies while exogenous attention is additive with them. See Klein (1994).


Endo is additive with opportunities for illusory conjunctions, exo interacts with them. See Briand \& Klein (1987).






Would orienting to gaze cues look more like endo or exo if combined with nonspatial expectancies and opportunities for illusory conjunctions?

STUDY SUMMARY
*************************
 
Is Posner's beam the same as Treisman's glue?


If we compare stimulus sets containing no possibility for illusory conjunction (RPB) and stimulus sets involving possibility for illusory conjunction (RPQ) and use the Posner cuing paradigm:


We should expect an interaction between cue validity and stimulus set.


I.e., we'd expect reaction time to be slower for cases where there are illusory conjunctions.


If the effect is merely additive, we'd expect RT to be fastest for valid cues, second fastest for neutral cues, and slowest for invalid cues, for both groups, and the slope of that slowing in RT shouldn't be radically steeper for the RPQ condition. I.e., if Posner's beam is NOT the same as Treisman's glue, we'd expect no interaction between stimulus set and cue validity.




Experiments 1-3 used central cues, and just found an additive effect. But, they were endogenous studies.


Experiment 4 used peripheral cues, and found an interaction. That's exogenous.


So, for endogenous orienting, Posner's beam is NOT the same as Treisman's glue. For exogenous orienting, Posner's beam is the same as Treisman's glue.


*************************
INTRODUCTION
*************************
The Past


Treisman's FIT vs Posner's visual orienting (PVO):


FIT: Attention is necessary to "glue" together properties into objects.


PVO: Attention is like a beam which is oriented selectively to certain areas.




Is Posner's beam the same as Treisman's glue?


 
Posner's Visual Orienting Model


Neutral cue, valid cue, and invalid cue.


Benefits of valid cue are calculated by difference in reaction time and/or accuracy between valid cue and neutral cue.


Costs of invalid cue are calculated by difference in reaction time and/or accuracy between invalid cue and neutral cue.


Overall cuing effect: Instead of neutral cue, you take total costs plus benefits (CBs) and calculate based on that.




Posner concluded that attention is like a spotlight. "Attention can be likened to a postlight that enhances the efficiency of detection of events within its beam" (Posner et al., 1980, p. 172).


Findings suggesting a spotlight:


Attention can't be easily allocated to non-adjacent regions.


Performance improvements gradually decrease as one moves away from the attended location, and this fall-off is steeper near the more densely represented fovea.


Shifts may take place with a fixed velocity.


Attention moves through intermediate positions.




Central cues occurring at fixation orient attention differently than do peripheral cues occurring at potential parafoveal locations.


Best peripheral cues are ones that we'd expect to draw eye movements. Orienting in response to peripheral cues is relatively automatic, compared to orienting in response to central cues which is strategic.






 
Treisman's Feature Integration Theory


There are separable dimensions (shape, colour, etc). Within these dimensions, there are values, which are features. Features are coded pre-attentively/automatically, and then conjunctions of features are synthesized in three ways:


Features coded are fit into pre-directed object frames.


Attention is directed to the location of a particular feature and serves to integrate it with other features present at the same location.


If attention isn't used, or if unexpected features occur, the coded features may conjoin on their own, resulting in illusory conjunctions.




Three paradigms for investigation: These are all indirect methods, where the manipulation of attention is inferred rather than directed.


Target search: Subjects look for specific target in an array full of distractors. Critical comparison is in searching for a conjunction compared with searching for a disjunction of features.


Texture segregation: Subjects report whether the border separating sections of a texture from one another is horizontal or vertical. Response latencies are faster when texture segregation is based on features than when it is based on conjunctions of features.


Identify and locate either feature targets or conjunction targets in a display of distractors. Probability of correct identification given incorrect location was greater than chance for feature targets but not for conjunction targets, so features can be identified w/out knowing their location but conjunctions cannot.




Paradigm for directly manipulating attention:


Studies probability of illusory conjunctions when stimulus duration is very short and attention is misdirected or overloaded.


Treisman \& Schmidt experiment 4: Array of four objects was displayed, each defined by combos of the dimensions of shape,  size, color, and solidity. Two distractor digits appear flanking the shapes. Instructions to report digits were intended to prevent subjects from focusing full attention on the display. Immediately after display offset, a probe appeared, and subjects reported the item shown at that location. Illusory conjunctions outnumber feature errors.


Experiment 5: Pre-cued location of targets rather than post-cue, and eliminated flanking numbers. Conjunction errors didn't occur, and errors tended to be based on feature intrusions.




Experiments 4 and 5 can't be used to demonstrate that misorienting in visual space increases likelihood of illusory conjunctions, b/c they confound the selectivity and capacity aspects of attention: Pre-cuing allows for greater selectivity in orienting, and also lowers capacity for what needs to be processed, whereas post-cuing doesn't allow for selectivity and leaves capacity at having to process all four items to identify the target. Therefore unclear whether illusory conjunctions occurred b/c attention was misdirected, overloaded, or both.




Taking experiments 4 and 5 into account, we need an experiment that compares performance in detection of targets that appear at cued or uncued locations, at the same time controlling for such things as processing demands of the task.


 
Rationale


Posner's system investigates attention's role in enhancing the detectability of stimuli in an uncluttered field, exploring properties of attention such as the duration and velocity of its movement and restrictions to its distributions in space.


Treisman's fiew emphasizes attention's role in conjoining free-floating attributes during visual search, and her program is aimed at converging evidence for this role.


Are the two programs exploring the same system from different perspectives? Is Posner's beam the same as Treisman's glue?


Treisman says no, arguing that she studies the type of attention that refers to selective scanning of competing external stimuli, whereas Posner's is for priming or expectancy effects which selectively preactivate particular perceptual dimensions.




Present study hypothesizes that the two systems are the same. Attention is a limited-capacity mechanism that can be allocated spatially. This is consistent with Posner. Furthermore, it would be unparsimonius to posit two separate systems.


Present study will combine Posner's orienting paradigm with a variant of Treisman's feature/conjunction task to test the hypothesis.


We should expect there to be a benefit to reaction time from central cues whether it be for feature search or conjunction search. Valid central cues should provide the biggest benefit, neutral cues faster than the invalid cues, but the benefit of cuing should be stronger for feature integration than for feature search, if Posner's beam is the same as Treisman's glue.




Target letter: R


Distractors: PB and PQ.


Task harder with PQ b/c of illusory conjunctions.




*************************
EXPERIMENT 1A
*************************


R isn't present in display. Performance should be worse with PQ stimuli than with PB, relative to appropriate controls. Should be a tendency for this difference when letters appear in unexpected location.


Critical data: Costs and benefits in reaction time and/or accuracy for the PB and PQ stimuli.


RT: Changes in probability of illusory conjunctions could show up in RT, b/c participants may slow down to reduce errors.


Accuracy: Less accurate for PQ than PQ means illusory conjunctions.




 
Method


Apparatus:


Subjects hold two remote control like objects:


Responding hand: Two buttons, one close to subject and one further away, each pressed by index and middle fingers respectively.


Nonresponding hand: Third button on a vertical bar for initiating trials.




Eye monitors used.




Stimuli: Upper case R, Q, P, and B shown on oscilloscope from distance of 49 cm, visual angle 0.53 degrees X 0.72 degrees.


840 trials:


240 trials with neutral prime (+) so that letters appeared equally often on left and right side.


480 trials with valid primes: Letters appeared in location indicated by the arrow, with equal number of left and right pointing valid cues.


120 trials with invalid cues: Letters appeared in location opposite to that indicated by the arrow.




Proportion of valid and invalid trials ensured that when an arrow was the warning signal, 80\% of the time it was a valid cue, and 20\% of the time an invalid cue.


12 possible permutations of two letters from four, each shown an equal number of times in left and right locations on the screen. For a given permutation in a given location there were 10 neutral cues, 20 valid cues, and 5 invalid cues. 12 permutations X 35 trials X 2 locations = 840 trials.




Procedure:


Trials begin with appearance of the fixation field, which also served as the intertrial stimulus.


When subjects fixated the center dot, they initiated the trial by pressing the center toggle switch button.


500 ms after pressing, warning cue appears superimposed over center dot, remains for 1000 ms.


Stimulus display appears for 100 ms, during which time the left and right dots were removed from the screen.


Subjects must determine whether an R was present in the display, and respond as quickly as possible by pressing the near button on the response board (for R) or far button (no R).


Subjects told they must keep fixated at center at all times during the trial. They were told the probabilities and were encouraged to direct their attention to the location indicated by the arrow without moving their eyes.


Three blocks of 280 trials were conducted on different days. Subjects began with calibration of the eye movement monitor followed by practice blocks of 10 trials until they scored at least 7 correct in two consecutive blocks.




*************************
EXPERIMENT 1B
*************************
Method


Rationale:


This is a control experiment.


An index of the magnitude of the conjunction effect is the absolute level of performance on the PB and PQ stimuli. But this isn't adequate simply b/c PQ could be slower and/or less accurate than PB b/c of dissimilarities in the particular examples of the letters Q and B that were used.


So, this experiment involved presentation of a single letter per trial from either the set RB or the set RQ. Subjects had to determine whether the letter R was present or not. Performance gave a baseline on the relative discriminability of the letters involved.


Participants informed of what stimulus set they'd receive.




********************************************
RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS 1A AND 1B
********************************************
Experiment 1A





For all trials where there were targets that did NOT have the correct target (R), reaction time was much slower.


Across the board, RT was slower for trials where R was not present.


Errors weren't that bad.




 
Experiment 1B


Subjects responded more quickly and more accurately to the RQ set than to the RB set.


********************************************
DISCUSSION OF EXPERIMENTS 1A AND 1B
********************************************


There was no difference in overall latency or accuracy between PB and PQ in Experiment 1A.


In Experiment 1B, there was an advantage for Q over B.


Since there was an advantage for Q in Experiment 1B and no difference between PB and PQ in Experiment 1A, then it looks like the advantage afforded by Q is lost in Experiment 1A, which is indirect evidence that PQ afforded opportunities for illusory conjunctions.


The conjunction effect must be increased beyond the levels of this experiment to get direct, rather than indirect, evidence.

	annote = {STUDY NOTES: EXPERIMENT 2
*************************
EXPERIMENT 2
*************************
Rationale


Perhaps two stimuli are insufficient for obtaining the illusory conjunction effect expected in Experiment 1A.


But, Treisman has pretty clearly argued that as long as you have two stimuli, you should be able to get an illusory conjunction.




It could be that mixed stimulus presentation in Experiment 1A may have made it inappropriate to have parallel feature and conjunction search strategies.


To increase conjunction effect above level obtained in Experiment 1, the distractor letters are now divided into separate blocks of trials (PB or PQ) given on different days.


This experiment will focus on performance on no trials (no R present) rather than yes and no trials, because splitting the two experiments should make the speed and/or accuracy for no answers worse.


 
Method


Apparatus and stimuli:


Two blocks of 224 trials; one containing letters RPB and another containing letters RPQ.


Frequency of yes and no trials was the same in each block (112).


For both blocks, 64 of the yes or no trials were valid cues, 16 were invalid cues, and 32 were neutral cues.




Procedure:


Same as Experiment 1. 10 subjects did RPB block first, 10 did RPQ block first.


Both sessions conducted on different days.




******************************
RESULTS OF EXPERIMENT 2
******************************





RPQ trials had higher response latency, and less accuracy on the neutral trials.




Response latency:


Main effect of stimulus set: RPQ longer response latency than RPB.




Accuracy:


Performance with RP was significantly more accurate than with either PB or PQ.


For no stimuli, PQ and PB did not differ in overall accuracy or in size of costs plus benefits.




********************************************
DISCUSSION OF EXPERIMENTS 1 AND 2
********************************************


The kind of attention moved around in the visual field is not serving the role of Treisman's glue. In other words, Posner's beam is NOT the same as Treisman's glue.


Even though attention was oriented to the cued location and a conjunction effect was obtained, these two factors did not interact. Costs plus benefits did not differ for the two stimulus sets.


So, there was a conjunction effect for random presentation of distractors (Experiment 1A) and for blocked presentation of distractors (Experiment 2), but the lack of an interaction between Stimulus (or set) X Cue supports the conclusion that Posner's beam is NOT the same as Treisman's glue.


},
	annote = {STUDY NOTES: EXPERIMENT 3
*************************
EXPERIMENT 3
*************************


Subjects may have gotten practice on day 1 of Experiment 2, so that may have influenced the results via the switch in strategy inflating the difference.


So, experiment 3 will just be a manipulation of stimulus set between subjects rather than within subjects.


All subjects will still do 2 days of either the RPQ or the RPB set.


******************************
RESULTS OF EXPERIMENT 3
******************************





Response latency:


Main effects of day, stimulus, and cue type.


Significant stimulus set effect (36ms).


No difference between costs plus benefits for either group.




Accuracy:


Significant effect of day and cue type.


Fewer errors with RPB than with RPQ.






****************************************************
COMBINED ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTS 2 AND 3
****************************************************


Results of Experiments 2 and 3 were combined to improve power.


Each day analyzed separately, with stimulus set as a between-subjects factor.


Results:


Day 1: RPB set was faster than RPQ set. Significant costs plus benefits. No interaction between costs plus benefits and stimulus set.


Accuracy showed no effects of stimulus set, costs plus benefits, or interaction between them.




Day 2: RPB set was faster than RPQ set. Significant costs plus benefits. No interaction between costs plus benefits and stimulus set.


Accuracy data showed a stimulus set effect, overall costs plus benefits, but no interaction between them.






********************************************
DISCUSSION OF EXPERIMENTS 1 -- 3
********************************************


Subjects responded more quickly and more accurately to RPB set.


Costs plus benefits were similar for the two sets, with no indication of a greater effect of cue validity for conjunction search.




In all three experiments, NO INTERACTION BETWEEN ORIENTING AND FEATURE?CONJUNCTION TRIALS.


Conclusion: Posner's beam is not the same as Treisman's glue.


Possible that, as Treisman suggests, orienting preactivates perceptual decisions rather than enhancing processing in the sensory pathway or from it to attentional mechanisms.


Also possible that orienting improves feature extraction, a stage logically prior to feature integration.


Also possible that illusory conjunctions are produced when attention is overloaded but not when it is spatially misdirected.


But this is rejected on the basis of other studies.






The endogenous/exogenous distinction:


It's possible that there's an attentional difference between central and peripheral cues.


Shifts following central cues receive strategic control (endogenous) whereas peripheral cues are more automatic (exogenous).


Inhibition of Return: Occurs when attention is moved away from a peripherally cued location, stimuli are inhibited after about 300 ms. Doesn't occur with central cues.




Treisman (1985): Used peripheral cues to direct attention to a location in the visual field prior to onset of a stimulus display. Subjects required to search for either features or conjunctions, and the locational cue could be valid or invalid. Treisman obtained a significant interaction between cue validity and target type.


Cue validity mattered only for conjunction targets, but not for features.


These findings conflict with Experiments 1-3, but it could be because peripheral cues orient an attentional system that is functionally different from that oriented with the central cues used in the present study.




Experiment 4, then, will be a replication of Treisman and Prinzmetal et al.


*************************
EXPERIMENT 4
*************************
Rationale


Can we get an interaction between cue condition and stimulus set if we use peripheral cues instead of central cues?


This is a replication of Experiment 3 except with peripheral cues and an SOA that is shortened to 160 ms.


 
Method


8 subjects did RPB set on 2 days, 8 did RPQ set.


Peripheral cue consisted of two arrows, one directly above and one directly below, that were pointing to the possible target locations.


Three types of cues:


Neutral condition: Peripheral cues occur at both locations.


Valid condition: Arrows point to location containing the letter pair.


Invalid condition: Arrows point to wrong location.




Same probabilities are in Experiment 3.


Arrows displayed for 80 ms, and 80-ms interstimulus interval (ISI) before stimulus display.

********************************************
DISCUSSION OF EXPERIMENTS 4
********************************************


This study found a larger effect of cuing for the RPQ stimulus set than for the RPB stimulus set. Therefore, when the beam is drawn by a peripheral cue, the beam plays the same role as Treisman's glue.


*************************
GENERAL DISCUSSION
*************************


So, is Posner's beam the same as Treisman's glue?


When the system is oriented endogenously, no.


When the system is oriented exogenously, yes.




Peripheral cuing produces larger costs plus benefits in conjunction search than feature search, as predicted by FIT.


Comparing Figures 3 and 4 with Figure 5, the cuing effect is the same for RPB and RPQ with central cues but with peripheral cues the cuing effect with RPQ is larger than that for RPB.


Speculating on endogenous/exogenous distinction and FIT:


Endo could work to extract or encode features more efficiently or alter the set for particular stimulus-response pairs at the decision level. But, it seems like feature integration is unlikely to be a function of the endo system.


Feature integration occurs after the stage of feature extraction and prior to a stage of conscious recognition. Exo performs the function of feature integration.


There could be overlap in the two mechanisms.


Treisman's filtering/set distinction: Set involves preactivating certain perceptual decisions and wouldn't play a special role in conjoining them. So, the endo system affects this step, not feature integration. The filtering mechanism operates on basic featural differences in the visual array, the kind of differences that would attract attention automatically, so it is therefore involved in feature integration.


Therefore, peripheral cues lead to minimal effects of cuing but large effects for conjunction search.






 
Exogenous Orienting and Feature Integration


Characteristics:


Peripheral cues lead to automatic attentional shifts.


Unlike central cues . . .


Peripheral cues produce the same effects whether they're informative or not.


Peripheral cues cannot be ignored despite instructions to do so.


Peripheral cues produce the same effects regardless of concurrent memory load.


Peripheral cues produce effects that are insensitive to the relative probability (expectancy) of central versus peripheral cues.


Peripheral cues produce very rapid orienting, with costs plus benefits sometimes reaching asymptote within 100ms.


The velocity of the beam that is oriented in response to a peripheral cue may be constant (Tsal, 1983):


Tsal used 100\% valid peripheral cues for a detection task and looked at detection time as a joint function of cue-stimulus SOA and stimulus (also cue) eccentricity. RT decreased with increased SOA and asymptotic SOA was a linear function of eccentricity.




Peripheral cues show IOR after at least 200ms after occurrence of a cue.




Exo, then, seems to be analogous to "foraging".




Applying orienting to FIT (speculation):


Contour or color changes at the edges of potential targets serve as peripheral stimuli attracting attention. Attention then rapidly directed to most strongly activated location, and repeated until a target is detected.


IOR makes it less likely that previously attended locations will be returned to.




 
Endogenous Orienting


In covert orienting, it matters whether attention was oriented with endo or exo.


Hard to tell whether endo can accurately be described by the spotlight metaphor.

	abstract = {Background
Schizophrenia research has gained a new focus on identification and further characterization of neurocognitive deficits in the search for behavioural endophenotypes of this disorder. The objective of this study was to explore differential cortical processing during executive control in schizophrenia as assessed with the attention network test (ANT).
Methods
Sixteen schizophrenic patients and sixteen healthy controls matched for gender, age, education, and nicotine consumption were tested with the ANT while recording 29-channel-electroencephalogram (EEG). Visual event-related potentials (ERP) N200 and P300 were topographically analyzed and cortical mapping using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was applied to localize neuroelectric generators of ERP.
Results
Behaviourally, significant differences between schizophrenic patients and controls were found only for the conflict condition (p{\textless}0.05) and for conflict adjusted by mean reaction time (p{\textless}0.01). Examining ERP of control subjects, N200 failed to show robust flanker congruency effects. P300 amplitude was reduced at Pz (p{\textless}0.05) and P300 latency was increased at Cz (p{\textless}0.005) for the conflict condition. Schizophrenic patients differed significantly in P300 latency at Cz during late conflict processing (p{\textless}0.005). Source analysis revealed a deficit in anterior cingulate cortex (p{\textless}0.05).
Conclusion
Our results are in line with previous reports about dysfunctional ACC activation in schizophrenia and argue in favour of a selective deficit of cortical conflict resolution. It is further proposed that dysfunctional ACC activation during executive processing may be a neurophysiologic endophenotype candidate of schizophrenia.},

STUDY SUMMARY
*************************







When the RTs from the two experiments were combined, the 3-way interaction between control (endo vs exo), stimulus/response likelihood, and cue condition was significant.


Comparing the magnitude of the cuing effects upon the likely stimulus with peripheral and central cues suggests that roughly equal amounts of visual orienting occurred in response to the two types of cues. However, in response to a central cue the subjects generated a spatial expectancy that interacted with a form/response expectancy, whereas with a peripheral cue there was no interaction with stimulus likelihood.


********************REMOVE****************


Key Terms:


Choice task: Either X happened or Y happened.


Stimulis-response likelihood: One type of target is more likely than the other.




Non-spatial expectancy task: You use Posner's cuing paradigm, and your targets either increase in luminance or decrease in luminance.


You setup the task so that for each participant, either luminance increase or luminance decrease is more likely. The cues are uninformative.


Participants have to respond with a choice: Was the target a luminance increase or decrease?




Findings:


Ok, without manipulations, we'd expect a few things:


(1) Valid trials should be faster than invalid trials.


(2) Likely trials should be faster than unlikely trials.


(3) Therefore, unlikely trials ought to just be slower versions of the likely trials.




For exo:


(1), (2), and (3) remain true. Stimulus/response likelihood is additive with cue condition, so the trend of cuing effects remains the same (fastest for valid and slowest for invalid) whether it's for likely or unlikely trials, it's just that you're slower for both with unlikely trials.




For endo:


(1) is partly false –– it's only true for likely trials. For likely trials, the trend is pretty similar, such that in likely trials, you're fastest with valid cues and slowest with invalid cues. However, for unlikely trials, you're almost just as fast for invalid cues as you are for valid ones, and you're slowest with neutral cues. So, (2) is true, but since (1) is only true of likely trials, (3) is false.




So, exo is additive with non-spatial expectancies, but endo is interactive with non-spatial expectancies.


This indicates that endogenous cuing causes the creation of a spatial expectancy.


So, directly stimulating a visual pathway (exo) prepares the system differently than does anticipating its stimulation (endo).






Combined with the findings of Briand \& Klein (1987), we find a double dissociation:


Endo is additive with opportunities for illusory conjunctions, and endo is interactive with non-spatial expectancies.


Exo is interactive with opportunities for illusory conjunctions, and exo is additive with non-spatial expectancies.

Abstract


Central + Peripheral Cues = Endo + Exo.


Task: Choice reaction time to report whether a cue expanded or contracted.


Stimulus/response probability (particular size change) interacted with cue condition (valid, neutral, invalid) when cues were endo but the two variables were additive when the cues were exo.


Suggests that endo and exo are qualitatively different resources.


 
Introduction


Covert orienting: "a change in the direction of visual processing in the absence of any change in gaze direction."


Jonides (1976, 1981) reported the earliest differences in endo/exo visual orienting:


Endo is affected by memory load and by the likelihood of a central vs peripheral cue. Exo is not.




Briand \& Klein (1987):


When using central cues, cue condition was additive with feature vs conjunction set.


When using peripheral cues, cue condition was interactive with feature vs conjunction set, with a larger effect of attention for conjunction set than with the feature set. So, exo is needed to perform feature conjunctions or avoid illusory conjunctions.







Briand (1993) repeated the endo/exo manipulation using conjunction and disjunction search with coloured forms, and got the same results. Posner's beam is different from Treisman's glue under endo control, but it is the same under exo control.


Klein and Hansen (1990): Explored endo covert orienting using simple and choice reaction time (RT) measures.


Two possible stimulus events: Peripheral dot increases or decreases in luminance, with one of these events being more likely than the other.


Simple RT: When subjects made one response regardless of the direction of luminance change, found similar spatial cuing effects for the likely and the unlikely change.


Choice RT: When subjects were required to discriminate between luminance increases and decreases, RTs showed a typical cuing effect for the likely change but not for the unlikely one. They referred to this as spotlight masking, b/c an early benefit (and cost) in response to the cue was being masked by a later response bias or pigeonholing effect at response/decision processing stages.




The interaction between endo cuing and stimulus/response probability suggests that maintenance of endo orienting, which involves an expectancy that a target event is likely to occur at a particular location shares some of the same machinery as does maintaining other, non-spatial expectancies.




The present experiment asks, will the same interaction be obtained if attention is controlled exogenously?


*************************
METHOD
*************************


Apparatus and stimuli:


Eye tracker


Response button held in left hand to initiate trials when fixating at central stimulus.


Responses to target made on two-key response board with index and middle fingers of right hand.


Cues:


Endo condition: Arrows pointing toward left or right box, or a plus sign.


Exo condition: Centre dot in one of the peripheral boxes was brightened for 160ms. Neutral cue was brightening of the centre dots in both peripheral squares.






Design and procedure:


1/2 of subjects assigned to endo condition, 1/2 to exo.


For 1/2 of subjects in each group the target event was much more likely to be expansion than contraction; reverse was true for remaining subjects.


This assignment had no impact on the results.




500ms after trial initiation, cue was presented which indicated that the likely target event was equally probable at both possible target locations (neutral condition) or else a location cue (arrow or peripheral luminance change) signaled probable location of likely target event.


3 possible cues (neutral, left, right) presented equally often. Non-neutral cues were uninformative for the unlikely event (expansion or contraction) which was therefore equally unlikely to occur at the two locations regardless of the cue.




SOAs:


Cue-target SOA in exo condition was 160ms (enough to produce asymptotic cuing effects) and yet short enough to avoid IOR.


Cue-target SOA in endo condition was 500ms (long enough to produce asymptotic cuing effects).




Catch trials: 17\% of all trials had no target.


Response times less than 100ms were considered anticipations. Those greater than 700ms were considered misses.


Each subject did three 1-1.5 hour sessions consisting of 2 blocks of 174 trials.

RESULTS
*************************


Data from each condition subjected to separate ANOVAs with stimulus likelihood (likely/unlikely), cue condition (neutral, valid, invalid) and location (left/right) as within-subject variables.


Endogenous Condition


Significant effects of . . .


Stimulus likelihood: Responses faster to likely event.


Cue condition: Responses faster in valid than in invalid or neutral conditions.


Interaction between stimulus likelihood and cue condition (as expected from Klein and Hansen, 1990).


Overall cuing effect (invalid RT minus valid RT) highly significant for likely stimulus, completely absent for unlikely one.


Errors:


Stimulus likelihood: More likely to classify unlikely stimulus as the likely one than vice versa, except for at the uncued (invalid condition) location (latter shows interaction between stimulus likelihood and cue condition).









Exogenous Condition


Significant effects of . . .


Stimulus likelihood


Cue condition


No interaction between stimulus likelihood and cue condition.


Errors:


Stimulus likelihood: More errors on unlikely stimulus (misclassifying it as the likely one).


Marginally significant trend for subjects to make more errors on right side than left side.






As predicted, when attention is exogenously attracted or pulled to a location, the subject responds more rapidly to all stimuli at the cued location, whether or not a stimulus is expected affects response time, but the effect of attention is identical for expected and unexpected events.

Comparing the magnitude of the cuing effects upon the likely stimulus with peripheral and central cues suggests that roughly equal amounts of visual orienting occurred in response to the two types of cues.

*************************
DISCUSSION
*************************

When there are likely and unlikely events that may occur at different locations and that call for separate responses, stimulus-response likelihood interacts with spatial cuing when the cuing is endogenous, as found by Klein and Hansen (1990).
When spatial cuing is accomplished exogenously (uninformative peripheral cue or a peripheral cue with meaning, but SOA too short to generate spatial expectancy) the two effects (stimulus/response likelihood and spatial cuing) are additive.
Endo vs Exo:

Exo interacts with opportunities for illusory conjunctions, so it influences a stage where feature integration occurs.
Endo is additive with feature versus conjunction search, so it doesn't influence the feature integration stage.
Endo interacts with other non-spatial expectancies, so it influences relatively late stages where response bias or pigeonholing operations take place.
Exo is additive with other non-spatial expectancies, so it doesn't influence the response bias late stage.
Both types of orienting are assumed to influence early stages that involve the extraction of features.


Endo and Exo are qualitatively different.

*************************
*************************
INTRODUCTION
*************************


Assumption: Theer is a fundamental difference between the registration or detection of individual features and the perception or detection of an arbitrary combination of such features. Spatial attention has some functional role in perceiving conjunctions of features.


Posner's cuing paradigm is great for testing the assumptions of FIT.


Briand \& Klein (1987), Prinzmetal, Presti, \& Posner (1986) and Treisman (1985) all reported the presence of a Target Type X Cue Condition interaction manipulated attention via exogenous cues, but not for endogenous cues.


*************************
EXPERIMENT 1
*************************


Replicate Target Type X Cue Condition interaction of Briand \& Klein (1987).


Remedying problems from Briand \& Klein (1987):


Searching for 2 features in the conjunction task could be more difficult than searching for one in the feature task. Task difficulty could interact with spatial attention.


So, a disjunctive feature search task in which there were always two possible target features on each trial was used to make the conjunction and feature tasks more comparable in terms of overall difficulty.




Participants were required to detect conjunctions of features between separate dimensions (colour and shape) rather than within-dimensions (like only form, from B\&K 1987).




Method


Apparatus and stimuli:


Stimulus set: Uppercase letters O, T, X, drawn in colours blue, red, and green.


Letters 0.6X0.8 degrees in size (viewing distance = 60cm) and displayed 2 degrees in visual periphery to left or right of a central fixation cross that remained on screen for entire session.


Two letters were side-by-side separated by approx. 0.2 degrees between them.






Within-subjects, 2 tasks: 25 mins each


Feature search task:


Detect letter O and the colour blue by pressing ? key on keyboard with right index finger, or press Z key with left index for "No".


400 trials:


200 trials: One or more of relevant stimuli present.


200 trials: No relevant stimuli present.




80\% valid, 20\% invalid.


Invalid trials:


Target present:20 combos of 2 different-colored letters that had either the letter O or the colour blue present.


40 trials, 20 on left side, 20 on right side.




Target absent: A red X paired with a green T and a red T paired with a green X.


40 trials, 10 on left and 10 on right for each.






Valid trials: x4 of the invalid trials.


Target present:


160 trials, 80 left and 80 right.




Target absent:


160 trials, 80 left and 80 right.










Conjunction search task:


Search the display for a blue O and respond yes or no.


400 trials


80\% valid, 20\% invalid


Invalid trials: 40 Target present and 40 Target absent trials.


Target present: Blue O paired with a red X, a red T, a green X and a green T, five times each at both the left and right stimulus locations for a total of 40 trials.


Target absent: 16 combos of different-colored letters having either blue or O present. Each shown once at each of the left and right stimulus locations for a total of 32 trials.


Remaining 8 Target absent trials came from displaying the two stimulus pairs having none of the features present, twice each at the left and right locations.






Valid trials: x4 of the invalid trials.


Target present: 160 trials.


Target absent:


64 O or blue trials.


32 no O or blue trials.










Procedure:


1-hr session.


Task:


Fixate at cross


Start by pressing space bar


800 ms later, arrow appears on left or right side of screen above and pointing toward location where stimulus letters would appear (arrow 0.3 X 0.3 degrees in size).


167 ms later, stimulus letters appear after onset of arrow and are shown for 83 ms.


Arrow removed at same time as letters.


Indicate ASAP Yes or No.


Following incorrect responses, 500-ms tone for feedback.


Participants initiate next trial at their own convenience.






Results





Discussion


Successful replication: Larger spatial cuing effects for a conjunction detection task than for a feature detection task.


Cue validity X Target type interaction obtained.

*************************
EXPERIMENT 2
*************************


Experiment 2 is just Experiment 1 but with endogenous cues.


Used same SOA as in Experiment 1, 167 ms.





Cuing effect, but no interaction.


Briand \& Klein (1987) compared exo cuing with a brief SOA and endo with a long SOA.


Even with a brief SOA for endo, significant cuing effects were found but magnitude of the cuing effect didn't differ for feature and conjunction detection.




},
	annote = {3.
************************
EXPERIMENT 3
*************************


In Experiment 1, cuing effects were 45 ms on average, whereas they were only 8 ms on average in Experiment 2. So, the lack of variability may have made the interaction impossible in Experiment 2.


167 ms SOA is barely long enough to observe an effect of endo cues on performance, and hence wouldn't allow for full allocation of spatial attention via endo cues. When spatial attention has more time to focus on the cued location, one would expect larger cuing effects.


Experiment 3 determined whether this was in fact correct and did so by presenting endo cues with a longer SOA of 500 ms.




Results





Significant effect of cue condition.


No Target Type X Cue Condition interaction.




Discussion


Failure to find interaction in Experiment 2 could've been b/c of brief SOA used in the experiment. But, on the basis of results from Experiment 3, that possibility must be rejected.

INTRODUCTION
******************

"What can gaze cueing reveal about the origins and neural bases of symbolic attention cueing?" (1)

 
Gaze Perception

How do infants achieve gaze perception? Gaze perception is the ability to use the eyes to derive information necessary for "skills in engaging in collaboration, deception, and inference of intentions and mental states" (2).
The Neural Basis of Gaze Perception (2):

Superior temporal sulcus (STS) codes biological motion and static biological information such as eye position (2-3).
Baron-Cohen (1995) proposed that "encoding of another's eye-gaze direction is an integral part of theory of mind" (3).
It seems that gaze direction is used differently depending on the context and perceived goals of a person's actions (3).
The amygdala is necessary for judging gaze direction and facial expression (4).
Parietal cortex necessary for orienting, specifically intraparietal sulcus (IPS) which is necessary for spatial processing and covert orienting (4).


How is Accurate Gaze Perception Achieved? (4):

The structure of the eye is important. The human eye is largely white, and then descends slowly into a darkest point, making it easier to track gaze shifts. And it's mainly the geometry of the eye that does this rather than the luminance (4-5).

Note: This geometry is probably what makes schematic faces good gaze cues.


The presence of objects also affects perceived gaze direction. So it's not just the geometry of the eye, but also predicting an object that a person is looking at, is involved in perceiving gaze (5).


What Are the Effects of Eye Contact? (5):

Eye contact is both a sign of aggressive approach (as in other animals), and a signal of attraction (for humans) (5-6).

Males (but not females) rate female faces that shift gaze toward them as more attractive, and less attractive when gaze is shifted away (6).


The presence of a central face with eyes pointing forward makes it harder for people to attend to peripheral objects (6).

"direct gaze both captures attention and delays disengagement of attention from the face stimulus" (6).


Haley and Fessler (2005): When you have people play a computer game where they can choose to share money, they share more money when the background on the computer contains schematic eyes than when it doesn't (6-7).


Gaze Perception and Joint Attention in Development (7):

Infants prefer faces with eyes (7).
At 4 months, infants have deeper face processing of faces with direct gaze, and at 5 months they get good at discriminating very fine horizontal deviations (5 degrees) of eye gaze. Still, it may not be until 3 y/o that children can determine whether an adult is making eye contact or where they're looking (7).
Hood, Willen, and Driver (1998): 3 m/o infants have facilitated saccades to gaze direction when faces are presented on a computer screen (7).

Farroni, Massaccesi, et al. (2004): Neonates must see eyes move to follow the gaze of another person (7).

Moore, Angelopoulos, and Bennett (1997) found that 9 m/o infants could use static gaze cues if they'd already developed the ability to use motion gaze cues (7).
"gaze contact–engaging attention on the face–followed by pupil motion, is vital to give rise to the more complex behaviors involved in joint attention in infancy" (8).




At 12-18 m/o, infants specifically use eye movements for gaze cues rather than just head turns, b/c if a person's eyes are closed and their head turns, the infant doesn't follow (8).
At 7 m/o, infants prefer to follow the gaze of a neutral face rather than a happy or sad face (8).
Gaze following at 6 m/o correlates w/vocabulary size at 18 m/o (8).
Development of joint attention at 20 m/o predicts theory of mind at 44 m/o (8).
By 9 m/o, infants correctly orient to the object adults are looking at rather than just to the closest object in spatial vicinity (8-9).
By 3-4 y/o, infants can use gaze to predict a person's intentions. E.g., If Charlie is looking at a chocolate bar, he probably wants the bar (9).

This is vulnerable to interference until 5 y/o. If an arrow next to the face is pointing the opposite direction, children under 5 fail to appropriately attribute intentions to the face (9).

STUDY SUMMARY
--------------
Short Summary
Global estimates of youth depression and anxiety have doubled during the pandemic, to 1/4 and 1/5 children respectively experiencing clinical elevation (in a meta-analysis of range from Jan. 2020 to March 2021). As the pandemic goes on, this gets worse. Girls are more vulnerable to depression and anxiety. Older children are more vulnerable to depression but not anxiety. Authors chalk up the general increase primarily to social isolation, school closures (leading both to social isolation and lack of access to mental health care, which 80\% of children access at school). Parents should ensure to maintain routines. Practitioners must offer appropriate mental health referrals. Policy makers must consider school and recreational closures a last resort. Tele health could be used for wide scale mental health service delivery.
Noteworthy Information

Studies in this meta-analysis were conducted sometime between January 1, 2020, and March 8, 2021.

Study Question

Meta-analysis
How has youth mental health been affected, worldwide, during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Results

29 samples, N = 80,879 youth
Doubling of youth clinically elevated depression and anxiety worldwide

Depression: Now 1 in 4 children (Prepandemic, 12.9\%; During pandemic, 25.2\%)

May be b/c children are socially isolated; lack of support networks in schools and friend groups; school closures, b/c schools are primary source of psychological care for 80\% of children.


Anxiety: Now 1 in 5 children (Prepandemic, 11.6\%; During pandemic, 20.5\%)

May be b/c children are socially isolated; lack of support networks in schools and friend groups; school closures, b/c schools are primary source of psychological care for 80\% of children.




Moderator variables:

Depression:

Time: Longer the pandemic went on, the worse things got

May be b/c earlier studies were conducted in East Asia and later studies were conducted largely in Europe. Self-reported prevalence of mental health symptoms tends to be lower in East Asia.


Sex: Females more likely to experience depressive symptoms.

May be b/c of biological susceptibility, lower baseline self-esteem, higher likelihood of having experienced interpersonal violence, exposure to stress b/c of gender inequity.


Age: Higher depression in older children.

May be b/c of puberty and hormonal changes, as well as social isolation b/c kids this age are especially reliant on socialization with peers.




Anxiety:

Time: Longer the pandemic went on, the worse things got

May be b/c earlier studies were conducted in East Asia and later studies were conducted largely in Europe. Self-reported prevalence of mental health symptoms tends to be lower in East Asia.


Sex: Females more likely to experience depressive symptoms.

May be b/c of biological susceptibility, lower baseline self-esteem, higher likelihood of having experienced interpersonal violence, exposure to stress b/c of gender inequity.


Age: NOT A MODERATOR FOR ANXIETY.

May be b/c younger and older children experience anxiety for similar reasons. Older children may notice parental stress more and be more bothered by the global situation. Younger children may be especially disrupted by changes to routine.







Implications

Families w/more routines had lower child depression and conduct problems.

May be best to maintain good routines, particularly for schoolwork, sleep, screen use, and physical activity.


Clinical references ought to be made for children that need it.
Social isolation risk to youth must be considered by policy makers.

School closures and halting of recreational activities should be considered a last resort.


Tele mental health a good opportunity for widescale mental health service delivery.

Study Limitations

Not very much data from underrepresented countries; hard to understand cross-regional differences.
Studies in meta-analysis were mostly cross-sectional; longitudinal data is needed, especially w/baseline estimates of anxiety and depression.
More studies needed with racial, ethnic, and gender diversity.
Self-report measures were used, and they were primarily administered to parents. Studies w/criterion standard assessments needed for finer results w/more understanding of other possible mental health problems at play.

	abstract = {Background
During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, mental health among youth has been negatively affected. Youth with a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), as well as youth from minoritized racial-ethnic backgrounds, may be especially vulnerable to experiencing COVID-19–related distress. The aims of this study are to examine whether exposure to pre-pandemic ACEs predicts mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in youth and whether racial-ethnic background moderates these effects.

Methods
From May to August 2020, 7983 youths (mean age, 12.5 years; range, 10.6–14.6 years) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study completed at least one of three online surveys measuring the impact of the pandemic on their mental health. Data were evaluated in relation to youths' pre-pandemic mental health and ACEs.

Results
Pre-pandemic ACE history significantly predicted poorer mental health across all outcomes and greater COVID-19–related stress and impact of fears on well-being. Youths reported improved mental health during the pandemic (from May to August 2020). While reporting similar levels of mental health, youths from minoritized racial-ethnic backgrounds had elevated COVID-19–related worry, stress, and impact on well-being. Race and ethnicity generally did not moderate ACE effects. Older youths, girls, and those with greater pre-pandemic internalizing symptoms also reported greater mental health symptoms.

Conclusions
Youths who experienced greater childhood adversity reported greater negative affect and COVID-19–related distress during the pandemic. Although they reported generally better mood, Asian American, Black, and multiracial youths reported greater COVID-19–related distress and experienced COVID-19–related discrimination compared with non-Hispanic White youths, highlighting potential health disparities.},

STUDY SUMMARY
--------------
Notable Information

Study conducted from May to August 2020 in the United States

Study Summary
A big sample of youth (7983) in the United States who were participating in a prior study joined a study on the effects of COVID-19 on mental health. The youths filled out three surveys during the months of May to August 2020 (survey 1, May 2020; survey 2, June 2020; survey 3, August 2020). The surveys included measurements of overall mood (which was also compared to prepandemic baseline) as well as the impact of COVID-19 on fears, worries, etc. The study found that generally speaking, youth mental health scores improved overall in the late Spring/early Summer of the pandemic. COVID-19-related fears/worries/stress, however, increased, and this was particularly noteable in minority youths (Asians and Blacks, who experienced discrimination) as well as in older adolescents, girls, and those with higher baseline internalizing symptoms (the latter 3 of which were also at greater risk of poorer overall mental health beforehand and during the months of the pandemic). Children with higher ACEs were more vulnerable to poorer mental health measures and COVID-19-related fears/worries/stress. Children with parents that had a high-school diploma or higher education experienced less fear of the virus. The study was limited, in that it wasn't as diverse as the previous ABCD study cohort, and it also didn't include as many children from lower-income backgrounds.
The authors say in the discussion, "Notably, across the early months of the pandemic onset (summer 2020), youth reported improvements in mental health, suggesting potential resiliency as the pandemic continues." It appears that they're suggesting resiliency rather than trying to demonstrate it. I think this may be confounded by a few things: COVID-19 cases in the United States remained relatively steady and low until October 2020, when they started to climb. Furthermore, cases were very low in most states for that period (although they were interpreted to be high at the time), with New York, Florida, Texas, and California making up huge numbers of the already relatively low (compared to later in the pandemic) case counts during that summer. Things really didn't start getting absolutely nuts until the Fall of 2020, so suggesting the results as a sign of resiliency going forward was fine for its time, but it simply didn't hold up as the pandemic continued.
Study Questions

Do ACEs predict worse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Does racial-ethnic minority status predict a stronger relationship between ACEs and mental health symptoms during the pandemic?

Methods

Study conducted from May to August 2020 in the United States
Children enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study: Nationwide United States study
Used school-based recruitment.
Study had baseline mental health data from earlier ABCD study, which it then compared to later COVID-19 survey data.
Demographic info (including family job/wage loss and changes in school environment) were reported by parents in the COVID-19 impact survey.

Results

N = 7983; recruited between 2016-2018 at ages 9 or 10.

Full ABCD study included 11,880 children. Of that cohort, 7983 participated in this study.
In this study, compared to the ABCD cohort the children were more likely to be White and to have higher parental education and household income. They were also less likely to have a history of ACE.


Sadness Scale:

ACEs: ACEs predicted greater sadness
Time: Sadness decreased
Race/ethnicity: Race was related to sadness. Black youths reported less sadness than non-Hispanic White youths.
Demographics: Older youths, girls, and those with greater internalizing scores reported greater sadness.


Positive Affect Scale:

ACEs: ACEs predicted less sadness.
Race/ethnicity: Race was related to positive affect. Black youths reported more positive affect than non-Hispanic Whites.
Demographics: Older youths, girls, and those with greater internalizing scores reported less positive mood.


Fear/Worry Scale:

ACEs: ACEs predicted more fear and worry.
Race/ethnicity: Race was related to fear/worry. Youths from minority racial or multiracial backgrounds reported greater fear/worry from COVID than White youths.
Demographics: Youths with household incomes between \$50k and \$100k as well as youths with household incomes ≥\$100k had greater internalizing scores. Girls reported greater fear and worry.


Anger/Frustration:

ACEs: ACEs predicted greater anger and frustration.
Time: Anger and frustration decreased over time.
Race/ethnicity: Race was related to anger/frustration. Black youths reported less anger and frustration than non-Hispanic White youths.
Demographics: Girls, youth with household incomes ≥\$100k, and those with greater internalizing scores reported more anger and frustration.


Perceived Stress Scale:

ACEs: ACEs predicted greater stress.
Time: Stress decreased over time.
Demographics: Older youths, girls, and those with greater internalizing scores reported greater stress.


Coronavirus Health Impact Survey COVID-19 Worry:

ACEs: ACEs did not predict COVID-19-related worry.
Time: Worry decreased over time.
Race/ethnicity: Significantly related to worry. Asian American and Black youths as well as other minority youths reported greater COVID worry, as well as Latinx youths.
ACE x race x time: High ACE Black youths were the only group that reported a reduction in COVID worry from survey 2 to survey 3.
Demographics: Girls and those with family wage loss and greater internalizing scores reported more COVID-19-related worry.


Coronavirus Health Impact Survey COVID-19 Uncertainty Stress:

ACEs: ACEs predicted greater COVID-19-related uncertainty stress.
Race/ethnicity: Race significantly related to stress. Minority youths reported more COVID-19-related uncertainty stress.
Demographics: Girls, those with family wage loss, and those with greater internalizing scores reported more COVID-19 uncertainty stress.


Fear of Illness and Virus Evaluation Scale: Impact of Illness and Virus Fears:

ACEs: ACEs predicted greater virus fears on well-being.
Time: Virus fears decreased over time.
Race/ethnicity: Race significantly related to impact. Minority youths reported greater impact of the virus on their well-being.
Demographics: Girls and those with higher internalizing scores reported greater impact of virus-related fears. Youths with well-educated parents (high school completion onwards) reported less impact of virus-related fears on their well-being.



Key Findings

After controlling for essentially everything, greater ACEs predicted worse outcomes on everything except COVID-19-related worry.
Mood symptoms and COVID-19-related distress improved across the three waves of data collection from May to August 2020.

May be b/c those who experienced greater early life stress were able to rebound faster.


Racial and ethnic minorities more likely to be impacted by COVID-19-related stress and worry.

May be b/c minority children's families are more likely to be exposed to the effects of COVID-19, including in infection, hospitalization, and mortality.
May also be b/c of racial discrimination, whether it be b/c of anti-Asian hate or responses to Black Lives Matter. Asians and Blacks reported more COVID-19-related racial discrimination, and this was a big predictor of COVID-19-related worry.


Greater pre-pandemic internalizing symptoms predicted worse outcomes on essentially every measure.
Females reported poorer mood and greater distress on COVID-19-related measures.
The improvement in mental health during the early months of the pandemic onset could suggest potential resiliency as the pandemic continues.

Study Limitations

Key limitation I see is that the sample was undersampled in minoritized and low-income families relative to the overall ABCD Study cohort.

	abstract = {The global public health crisis caused by COVID-19 has lasted longer than many of us would have hoped and expected. With its high uncertainty and limited control, the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly asked a lot from all of us. One important central question is: how resilient have we proved in face of the unprecedented and prolonged coronavirus pandemic? There is a vast and rapidly growing literature that has examined the impact of the pandemic on mental health both on the shorter (2020) and longer (2021) term. This not only concerns pandemic-related effects on resilience in the general population, but also how the pandemic has challenged stress resilience and mental health outcomes across more specific vulnerable population groups: patients with a psychiatric disorder, COVID-19 diagnosed patients, health care workers, children and adolescents, pregnant women, and elderly people. It is challenging to keep up to date with, and interpret, this rapidly increasing scientific literature. In this review, we provide a critical overview on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health and how human stress resilience has been shaped by the pandemic on the shorter and longer term. The vast literature is dominated by a wealth of data which are, however, not always of the highest quality and heavily depend on online and self-report surveys. Nevertheless, it appears that we have proven surprisingly resilient over time, with fast recovery from COVID-19 measures. Still, vulnerable groups such as adolescents and health care personnel that have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic do exist. Large interindividual differences exist, and for future pandemics there is a clear need to comprehensively and integratively assess resilience from the start to provide personalized help and interventions tailored to the specific needs for vulnerable groups.},

STUDY SUMMARY
--------------
Notable Information
This study is very long, and since I'm only writing about youth, I'll focus on the results for children, adolescents, and college students. It covers short and long term data (up until {\textasciitilde}September 2021).
Study Summary
Past research has shown that overall, people have been fairly resilient, recovering quickly from COVID-19-related measures.  However, adolescents and health care personnel have been severely impacted by the pandemic. "The mental health of children, adolescents, and students has been particularly affected by the pandemic" (23). For children, parental stress, loss of regular health care, etc. affected mental health. In adolescents, parental stress was less a determinant of resilience than it was for children. Even in the early days of the pandemic (Spring 2020), adolescents were experiencing almost double the typical rates for anxiety and depression, perhaps upwards of 43.7\% for depression symptoms and 37.4\% for anxiety symptoms. For adolescents, risk factors included being female, lacking physical exercise, and lacking social support. There were, however, conflicting results, with many studies also suggesting that the vast majority of adolescents didn't experience worsening mental health during COVID (at least in the early days), and there may have been decreases in suicide rates briefly. In college students, many experienced anxiety and depression, although sometimes this was accompanied with less internalizing symptoms and more externalizing symptoms. Girls and those with less social support were more at risk. Those with good coping strategies (relaxation, routines, exercise, etc.) were protective.
Generally speaking, the pandemic had negative effects on mental health for children, adolescents, and youth. But these risks varied a lot within groups. For children and younger adolescents, parental stress and decreased physical activity were important risk factors. But in adolescents and students, COVID-19-and academic related worries, family conflict, loneliness, and lack of health behaviours were important risk factors. Generally, youth were vulnerable during COVID, but those with coping strategies could find signs of resilience.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the coronavirus disease pandemic spread across the United States and protective measures to mitigate its impact were enacted, parents and children experienced widespread disruptions in daily life. Our objective with this national survey was to determine how the pandemic and mitigation efforts affected the physical and emotional well-being of parents and children in the United States through early June 2020.
METHODS: In June 2020, we conducted a national survey of parents with children age {\textless}18 to measure changes in health status, insurance status, food security, use of public food assistance resources, child care, and use of health care services since the pandemic began.
RESULTS: Since March 2020, 27\% of parents reported worsening mental health for themselves, and 14\% reported worsening behavioral health for their children. The proportion of families with moderate or severe food insecurity increased from 6\% before March 2020 to 8\% after, employer-sponsored insurance coverage of children decreased from 63\% to 60\%, and 24\% of parents reported a loss of regular child care. Worsening mental health for parents occurred alongside worsening behavioral health for children in nearly 1 in 10 families, among whom 48\% reported loss of regular child care, 16\% reported change in insurance status, and 11\% reported worsening food security.
CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease pandemic has had a substantial tandem impact on parents and children in the United States. As policy makers consider additional measures to mitigate the health and economic effects of the pandemic, they should consider the unique needs of families with children.},

STUDY SUMMARY
--------------
Notable Information

Study ran only until early June 2020.

Study Summary
27\% of parents reported worsening mental health for themselves, and 14\% reported worsening behavioural health for their children. Among the families whom this occurred in, those families were at higher risk for loss of regular child care (48\%), change in insurance status (16\%), and worsening food security (11\%). Behavioural issues in children may be able to be dealt with with routines, exercise, mental health support, and other coping strategies.
Study Questions

How has the pandemic affected the physical and emotional well-being of parents and children in the United States during the pandemic?

Methods

Early June 2020, national survey of parents w/children age {\textless} 18. Measure changes in health status, insurance status, food security, use of public food assistance resources, child care, and use of health care services since the pandemic began.
Asked about changes in health status, insurance status, food security, use of public food assistance resources, child care, and use of health care services since the pandemic began.

Results

27\% of parents reported worsening mental health for themselves.
14\% of parents reported worsening behavioural health for their children.
Proportion of families with moderate or severe food insecurity increased from 6\% prior to March 2020 to 8\% after.
24\% of parents reported loss of regular childcare.
Worsening mental health for parents occurred alongside worsening behavioural health for children in nearly 1/10 families, among whom 48\% reported loss of regular child care, 16\% reported change in insurance status, and 11\% reported worsening food insecurity.

STUDY SUMMARY
--------------
Short Summary
Overall, it appears that in the first wave of COVID (February to July 2020), youth (0-19) were more likely to experience mental health problems (18-60\% of youth; higher than prepandemic estimates). Estimates for depression symptoms were around 25\%, and for anxiety symptoms they were around 20\%. There isn't an indicator that suicide increased during the first wave. Reports of child abuse and medical referrals dropped a lot (27\% reduction, Florida; 36\% reduction, UK, respectively) but these also coincided with school closures, and it appears that school reports of these issues dropped by around 50\%. There was also a 50-65\% reduction in self-harm admissions and a 40\% reduction in psychiatric admissions, which, in the context of increasing psychological distress and decreasing access to school-based reports, suggests that some youth had mental health needs that went unmet in the first wave. It appears that the average amount of physical activity in children dropped, but if you break it down some kids (36-47\%) were exercising less and some (24-25\%) were exercising more. Percent of children with screen time over 3 hours increased (30-50\%) but few studies separated screen time for school from screen time for social media. It's very difficult to separate the effects of school closures from the broader social lockdowns because every study coincided with social lockdown. Still, it appears that loss of daily routine was potentially damaging (perhaps to behavioral health in children) and it looks like school closures were responsible for most of the reduction in social mixing amongst youth (who experienced less of a drop in social mixing than all other age groups).
Noteworthy Information

N = 79,781 children; 18,028 parents

Across 36 studies


Only during first wave of COVID (February to July 2020)

Study Question

How have school closures and social lockdowns affected youth mental health? A systematic review

Results

Broadly speaking: Adverse mental health symptoms; bad health behaviours (higher screen time, lower physical activity).
Mental Health and Well-Being:

Suicide:

No significant increase in suicide in England; but COVID/lockdown factors deemed to account for 48\% of 26 suicide deaths during lockdown.
One Canadian study found that 17.5\% of individuals aged 16-18 years old reported suicidal ideation in the past week, compared to 6\% in the pre-COVID-19 estimates.


Mental Health Symptoms:

Some studies have reported higher ranges of mental health symptoms (44\%+), but for the most part, it looks like depression symptoms float around 25\% and anxiety symptoms around 20\%.
Overall, it looks like most studies reported higher symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression as well as behavioural issues than pre-COVID. But a handful of studies did find no difference, and some even found slight improvement.
18-60\% of children and adolescents scored above thresholds for risk of psychological difficulties (higher than pre-COVID).


Well-being:

Very small number of low quality studies on overall well-being; looks like they reported minor worsening of well-being scores.


Child abuse:

Reported child abuse cases dropped a lot (around 27\%), but the majority of child abuse cases in these areas (Florida and the UK) are reported by schools, and the number of school-based reports dropped dramatically.
Medical referrals for children dropped a lot (36\% in the UK), but again, over half of the referrals from schools vanished upon school closure.


Sleep:

Studies were all over the place. I can't draw any conclusions other than that it looks like there might not have been a difference.




Health Behaviors:

Physical activity:

It looks like in many places, the average amount of physical activity kids were getting dropped. However, this is because it dropped for many kids (between 36 and 47\% of kids) but also rose for many kids (24-25\%). Still, it seems that overall the average physical activity dropped.


Screen Time and Social Media:

Screen time data sucks because it reports an increase, but the studies didn't consistently break apart overall screen time and kind of screen usage (e.g. at home learning vs cell phone).
Percent of children using social media for more than 3 hours a day increased, somewhere between 30 and 50\% on weekdays.

Doesn't look like there's an increase on weekends.






Associations with Socioeconomic Status:

Evidence not very good. Many studies didn't break down at all; some found lower education families had worse anxiety; some found no difference.
Overall very few studies on this.



Implications

Almost all studies documented poorer mental health and well-being compared to pre-COVID estimates.
None of the studies were capable of separating school closure effects from effects of social lockdowns.

Authors say there are strong theoretical reasons to believe school closures would have specific effects, like not mingling with social contacts and radical change in daily routine.
Furthermore, evidence shows that children and adolescents had less of a loss in social mixing than other age groups during lockdowns. This suggests that the majority of the reduction in social mixing for youth was school closure.


18-60\% of youth scored above thresholds for risk of psychological difficulties (higher than pre-COVID).
50-65\% reductions reported in presentations for self-harm; 40\% reduction in psychiatric admissions.

This plus the increase in psychological distress (and notably the school closures, considering how many children rely on school care) suggests that there were lots of unmet mental health needs during first wave.


Upwards of 1/4 of children may have developed sleeping problems.
Overall, decrease in healthy behaviours (e.g. physical activity) and increase in unhealthy diet and screen time behaviors (latter hard to separate from online learning).
Possibility for long-term sequelae.

Study Limitations

Narrative synthesis rather than a meta-analysis.

Apparently the heterogeneity of the designs and measures was too high to do so.
Narrative synthesis = "grouping studies according to the type of outcome".
Greater qualitative weighing to longitudinal and higher quality studies.


No formal assessment for reporting bias or publication bias.
No studies separated school closures from broader social lockdowns.
Couldn't break down data specifically by age.

The parent–child relationship is fundamental to shaping children’s trajectories through adolescence and suggests considerable potential to improve youth SRH knowledge. Lack of parent–child sexual communication (PCSC) may cause youth to turn instead to questionable information sources, such as peers, the internet and social media. The limited research in this area, and specifically in the Middle East, led us to explore how parents discuss SRH issues with their children and pinpointed the potential role for parents in supporting their children’s SRH needs. A qualitative research approach was used, with 20 focus groups stratified by nationality and sex of participants from four major communities in Jordan. Thematic coding and analysis was used. Parents described their willingness to “break the culture of shame.” Three primary strategies emerged: (1) the gender match, (2) mothers as a safe space and (3) seeking help from others, which included two sub-themes: incorporating others, and relying on the delivery of SRH information in schools. Strengths and challenges were inherent within each strategy, and discussion topics varied according to the strategy used. Evidence from this study provides an opportunity for future research and programming to improve adolescent health outcomes within conservative milieus to break the intergenerational cycle of shame. Interventions are suggested to target parents’ knowledge and self-confidence to help youth achieve their sexual development. Using gender-matched PCSC strategies, school-based platforms and religious institutions are ways to destigmatise such topics.},

20 focus groups in Jordan.
Parents described willingness to "break the culture of shame."

Three strategies:

Gender match

Study Question \#1: What prompts conversations about sexuality between children and parents?

Usually the child asks questions.
Very rare for parents to prompt discussion, but when they did, it was when they decided the child was "old enough".

Study Question \#2: What prevents conversations about sexuality between children and parents?

Thinking the child is too young.

 
Study Summary

The study aimed to answer five key questions:

(1) What barriers prevent parents from engaging in PCSC?
(2) Do the impacts of these barriers vary by the gender of the child and/or parent?
(3) Does the extent to which a parent feels capable of engaging in PCSC affect the number of barriers they feel are preventing PCSC?
(4) Does the extent to which a parent values PCSC affect the number of barriers they feel are preventing PCSC?
(5) What events prompt PCSC?


186 parents of children living at home who were under the age of 21 were given a series of questions and asked to rate how much they agreed with certain statements.
Answers to the questions:

(1) The two main barriers are the age of the child (parents worrying that the child is too young) and whether the parents think the child will actually listen to what they have to say. As children got older, parents felt the children were more ready, but also less likely to listen.

Therefore, there may be a "narrow window" of opportunity that is ideal for PCSC.


(2) Gender did not predict the impact of these barriers, contrary to past studies. Maybe these families are more egalitarian.
(3) The more capable parents feel of engaging in strong PCSC, the less likely they were to feel that there were barriers to PCSC.
(4) The more parents valued PCSC, the less likely they were to feel that there were barriers to PCSC.
(5) The events that most commonly prompt PCSC were the parent feeling that the child is old enough, the children hinting or asking questions about sex, the children beginning dating, and the beginning of sex ed in school.


Conclusions:

Interventions to reduce barriers could include:

Need to find "narrow window" of opportunity for PCSC.
Need to encourage on-going rather than one-time PCSC.
Make parents feel prepared to answer unexpected questions from children.
Offer parents resources weeks before sex ed pops up in school.





 
********************
INTRODUCTION
********************

Four research questions:
RQ1: What barriers do parents perceive to engaging in parent-child sexual communication (PCSC)? Do these barriers vary by the child and/or parent's gender?

Motivations:

PCSC predicts sexual outcomes for children–young people who had PCSC are less likely to be sexually active, and if they are, are more likely to practice safe sex measures like condoms and birth control (Beckett et al., 2010).
Not very much research on the role of gender. Most of the research is done with mothers, not very much with fathers (Heisler, 2005).
Parents less likely to talk to sons about sex (Afifi, Afifi, \& Aldeis, 2008).




RQ2: Do barriers vary by the child's age?

Motivation:

Parents often engage in PCSC when it is too late to reap the benefits of safe sex practices (Beckett et al., 2010).




RQ3: Does self-efficacy predict how much parents value PCSC?

Motivation:

Self-efficacy (whether a person feels capable of doing something) varies (Bandura, 1982). It is also unknown how much influence the value a parent places on PCSC plays.




RQ4: What events prompt PCSC, and how do those events vary by the gender of the child and the parent?

Motivation:

Puberty onset predicts PCSC (Byers et al., 2008).
Children hinting at sex, and their own engaging in dating predicts PCSC (Elliott, 2012).





 
********************
METHODS
********************

Participants:

186 parents (47\% male) living in the United States.
Avg. age of parent 41.24 yrs (SD = 9.77).
Parents must be living with at least one of their children under 21 y/o.
Total of 95 sons, 91 daughters.


Measures:

Barriers: Parents given list of 6 possible barriers to PCSC, asked if those barriers affected them.
Self-efficacy: 3-item scale, asked how much they agree w/each item.
Value of PCSC: Asked to rate how much they agree w/these questions:

"I think it's important for parents to talk to their children about sex."
"I think parent-child communication about sex has a positive effect on young people."


Prompts: List of 7 possible prompts, asked to check off what ones prompted them to engage in PCSC the last time they did.



 
********************
DISCUSSION
********************

Findings:

Gender not related to barriers or prompts of PCSC.

Weird in the face of past research.


Parents think their kids are too young for PCSC, but as the child gets older that barrier is replaced by a perception that the child doesn't want to hear what the parent has to say. Future interventions must try to find a narrow window of opportunity for PCSC.

NeeMost frequent barrier was feeling the child was too young. As kids became older, this was less likely to hold.
Another barrier was thinking the child didn't want to hear what the parent had to say–as children became older, this was more likely to hold.


The more capable a parent felt of engaging in PCSC, the more likely they were to do it. Furthermore, the more they regarded valuing PCSC, the more likely they were to do it.

Communication self-efficacy and perceived value of PCSC both negatively associated with barriers to PCSC.


Biggest prompt of PCSC was the parent feeling that the child was old enough.

This indicates that the parents were thinking that the "talk" is a one-time event, when it's actually more beneficial to have ongoing PCSC (Martino, Elliott, Corona, Kanouse, \& Schuster, 2008).


Second biggest prompt of PCSC was the child asking questions about sex.

We need interventions that can enable parents to respond to unexpected questions from their children early on, and to make parents feel prepared.


Another prompt was the child getting sex ed in school.

Parents should be offered resources weeks before the child starts sex ed in school.




Limitations

Lack of perspectives from children.
Need studies on parenting style and communication style, and how they may affect PCSC.
No indication of the frequency to which PCSC occurred. Parents were only asked about the last time they engaged in PCSC.

25 parents of young children (0-6) in a focus group.
Parents wanted to be their child's primary sex educator, and they wanted to do better than their parents and their own sex education afforded them.
Overall, parents focused mostly on wanting to teach kids about the anatomy of sex rather than the actions and their corresponding values. Parents did report that their own sexual education, both in school and from parents, was often embarassing and didn't include sufficient info on actions, values, relational aspects of sexuality, etc. Some parents reported wanting to talk about these things.
Parents reported discomfort with talking about intercourse, masturbation, and sexual orientation.
Parents reported discomfort with teaching their opposite sex children, preferring their partner to do it.
Parents wanted further education on PCSC, and many wanted it to be an ongoing process rather than a single thing.
Parents were worried about whhen they should cover certain topics.
Parents seemed to think, strangely enough, that "the talk" was a one-time thing, even though they wanted ongoing education themselves. Although they were aware that as their children got older, they'd talk to them about it more.

 
********************
INTRODUCTION
********************

The Parents as Primary Sexuality Educators program (PAPSE) with parents of young children (infant-age 12) has been shown to be effective in teaching parents how to engage in PCSC.
Current study used focus groups of parents with young children (0-6 y/o) to determine the following:

(a) parental comfort with parent-child sexual communication (PCSC)
(b) barriers to PCSC
(c) concerns about PCSC
(d) current PCSC efforts
(e) desired info and programming for PCSC



 
********************
METHODS
********************

Four focus groups, total N = 25 parents.

10 males, 15 females.

5 uni profs/instructors, 9 uni workers, 2 homemakers, 1 psychologist, 2 buisnesspeople, 1 building contractor, 4 community services workers.
17 were White, 3 Hispanic, 3 Biracial, 2 Black.


Avg age 37.6 yrs (SD = 5.5).
23/25 were married.


Procedures

Short demographic survey
Short questionnaire measuring:

perceived capability and comfort in PCSC
likelihood of attending PCSC educational program
barriers to participating in a PCSC educational program
helpfulness of various information sources about PCSC
interest in the potential topics to be covered in a program




Limitations

Small N
Participants were volunteers for the study
Participants were highly educated
Overall, may reflect the population most likely to participate in a program on parent-child sexual communication



 
********************
RESULTS
********************

Quantitative:

Parents felt very capable of answering the questions their children may pose to them
Parents felt comfortable explaining answers to questions their children may pose to them
36\% said they'd be somewhat likely to participate in a PCSC education program; 52\% said very likely.
Participants rated barriers from highest to lowest:

lack of childcare
job responsibilities
lack of program information


Participants rated what kinds of educational programs would be most helpful:

Face-to-face program
Support groups or small interactions




Qualitative: Several topics emerged during discussion

Personal experience with sexuality education: Parents' own experiences growing up influenced how they thought about PCSC today.

Many reported a lack of discussion within their home.
Lack of books in their home.
Lack of sex ed programs in school, or if they did get sex ed in school, it mostly focused on sexual anatomy and not on sexual action. Also a lack of information in schools about the opposite sex–boys and girls often separated for sex ed.
Parents being too awkward and embarrassing to talk to about sex.


Current state of sexuality education in the home:

Many reported wanting to be their child's primary sexual educator, and to do better for their child than their own parents had done for them.
Wanted to use correct anatomical terms with their children, talk about self-exploration via self-touching, boundaries and safety, reproduction.
Parents, when asked what they think of when they think of sexuality, reported things mainly like birth control, anatomy, and reproduction. They thought "the talk" was about the basics of reproduction, rather than on sexual action, love, relationships, gender roles, etc.
With further questioning, some parents reported wanting to provide info on relational aspects of sexuality.


Comfort and confidence in discussing sexuality:

Parents felt comfortable with answering their child's questions, but they were concerned about whether they'd be comfortable answering questions as their children got older.
Barriers included gender differences (how should a mother communicate sexuality to her son?), embarrassment.


Content and timing:

Parents were worried about when they should talk to their kids, and how they should vary the information and language they use depending on the child's age.
Parents felt that by the time a kid was in kindergarten, they should know something about body parts, self-touching, boundaries, safety, privacy, and sexual victimization, as well as socially acceptable behaviour.
Parents felt topics like sexual intercourse, masturbation, and sexual orientation were challenging topics.


Importance of a united front:

Parents felt it was important that they and their partners had as little conflict as possible in terms of cultural, political, and personality-based attitudes towards sexuality.


Future programming:

Parents reported already using information from the Internet, other parents, their child's teachers, and books to engage in PCSC.
Parents wanted a PCSC program. Format suggestions varied widely, including:

a hot line
lunch-and-learn
ongoing series
just one evening session


Face-to-face programs must remove barriers such as access to childcare, offering food for the kids.
Location or sponsor of a program could influence how parents rated credibility of the programs:

Academic departments
Childcare centers
Churches
Healthcare providers
Schools


Strategies:

support groups or small group interaction
role play activities

38 college students; racially heterogenous sample; focus-groups asking them about their experiences with PCSC.
Research questions:

RQ1: What topics do emerging adults report they discussed with their parents during PCSC? Are certain topics discussed more in female vs male focus groups?
RQ2: How do emerging adults describe the type of communication style used during PCSC? Are certain communication styles discussed more in female vs male focus groups?
RQ3: What values do emerging adults report were communicated during PCSC? Are certain values discussed more in female vs male focus groups?
RQ4: What suggestions do emerging adults provide for improving PCSC? Are certain suggestions discussed more in female vs male focus groups?


Breakdown by research question:

RQ1, Topics of PCSC: Adolescent sexual activity, birth control and contraceptives, abstinence/waiting to have sex, and parents' personal experiences.

Parents didn't discuss medical facts or health info regarding sexuality. Rather, they focused on messages that could influence the child's behaviour.
Females got more discussion on sexual activity, birth control and contraceptives, and parents' personal experiences.


RQ2, Communication Style: Most common style was closed communication, characterized by directives and dismissal of the child's input.

Parents often use scare tactics.
Awkwardness.
No gender differences in communication style, except that males get more scare tactics (particularly regarding unwanted pregnancy).


RQ3, Values Communicated in PCSC: Accepting values were more common and implicated less restriction on adolescent sexual behaviour. But conservative values did occur.

Females receive more conservative values than males.


RQ4: Suggestions for Improving PCSC: Participants wanted open and support PCSC.

Requests for open PCSC more common for females.
Participants refer same-gender PCSC (especially females).

There is research suggesting that opposite-gender PCSC is good for females (less sexual risk and more dyadic sexual communication w/partner) and males.
Work must be done, then, to decrease the awkwardness of opposite-gender PCSC.


Preference for PCSC to start earlier, and to include discussions of emotional/relational aspects of sex, parents' personal stories, and information regarding access to birth control.
Some participants preferred to avoid PCSC altogether, but this appears to be b/c of a fear of awkwardness.




Implications:

Parents should avoid scare tactics so they can better connect w/their child instead of shutting down discussion.
Parents' personal stories may be useful, particularly for teaching important lessons.
Open and supportive communication should be preferred over lecturing or threatening.
Many parents offered incorrect medical info about sex, so kids should get this from school instead. School should supplement PCSC.
Educational programs on PCSC must be offered for parents. Should be focused on preventing awkwardness and moralizing.



********************
INTRODUCTION
********************

PCSC improves adolescent sexual health and self-efficacy (DiIorio, Pluhar, \& Belcher, 2003; Widman, Choudkas-Bradley, Noar, Nesi, \& Garrett, 2016).
Children whose parents talk w/them about sexual topics are more likely to postpone sexual activity, participate in safe-sex practices, and report greater sexual satisfaction (de Graaf, Vanswesenbeeck, Woertman, \& Meeus, 2011; DiIorio et al., 2003; Parkes, Henderson, Wight, \& Nixon, 2011); Troth \& Peterson, 2000; Widman et al., 2016).
This paper descriptively explores young adults' recollections of PCSC during adolescence as well as their suggestions for how these discussions could have been improved.

Literature Review

Topics of PCSC:

Mostly focused on sexual anatomy rather than sexual activity (Ritchwood et al., 2018).

There is a significant degree of embarassment in talking about sexual activity; less so with anatomy (Ogle, Glasier, \& Riley, 2008).


Gender determines topics; girls get more info on pregnancy, relationships, biology, and abstinence than males do (Flores \& Barroso, 2017; Kim \& Ward, 2007; Wilson \& Koo, 2010).


Communication Characteristics of PCSC:

PCSC ought to be open, comfortable, interactive, friendly, and attentive, if the goal is to decrease adolescents' sexual risk behaviours (Rogers, Stormshak, \& Dishion, 2015).
Much of PCSC is parent-dominated, with little child input (Hyde et al., 2013).
Males have less of an interactive experience than females, particularly in PCSC with mothers. They're more withdrawn and contemptuous than females (DiIorio et al., 2003).


Values:

Parents in many countries have conservative values, encouraging their kids to abstain until marriage and to practice safe sex but wait till they're older (Negy et al., 2016; Grossman et al., 2018).
Parents broadly are more accepting of male sexual expression and activity (so long as it is safe) than they are for girls, who they stereotypically encourage to be moral and abstain (Goldfarb et al., 2018; Negy et al., 2016).


Suggestions for Improvement:

Past literature has suggested that adolescents want open communication that is non-judgmental (Goldfarb et al., 2018).

They want it to be an interactive process, rather than one where the parent just tells the child without listening to the child (Pariera \& Brody, 2018).
They want parents to discuss not only sexual anatomy but also sexual activity, as well as controversial topics like STDS/HIV, masturbation, etc., and the parents' own personal stories (Pariera \& Brody, 2018).





 
Present Study

The present study explores young adults' experiences of PCSC during adolescence, including: topics, communication style, values, and suggestions for improvement.
It will also explore whether gender differences emerge amongst these experiences, with a particular focus on communication style and suggestions for improvement.
Research questions:

RQ1: What topics do emerging adults report they discussed with their parents during PCSC? Are certain topics discussed more in female vs male focus groups?
RQ2: How do emerging adults describe the type of communication style used during PCSC? Are certain communication styles discussed more in female vs male focus groups?
RQ3: What values do emerging adults report were communicated during PCSC? Are certain values discussed more in female vs male focus groups?
RQ4: What suggestions do emerging adults provide for improving PCSC? Are certain suggestions discussed more in female vs male focus groups?


I really like that this study is including values as a topic. They really seem to agree that actions imply values, and that it is very difficult to understand the one without the other.

Note: Just thinking about actions and values, and I came up with this definition of action: Actions are facts that are brought into being by value-seeking creatures. As such, actions have implicit value, because they are things that are valued and selected for that purpose.



 
********************
METHODS
********************

Participants selected from a sample of first year college students in a larger study examining emerging adults' experiences with sex-ed, PCSC, and hooking up behaviours.
Data collected in Southwest USA in 2012.
N = 38.

57.9\% White, 18.4\% Black, 18.4\% Hispanic, and 5.2\% multiracial or Pacific Islander.


Broken into six focus groups by self-identified gender (3 male groups, 3 female groups).
Demographic survey.
Semi-structured interview.
Thematic analysis of interview results.

 
********************
RESULTS
********************

Not all reported having engaged in PCSC w/their parents. However, of the ones who did, a few themes emerged:

Adolescents' Sexual History/Activity: Many reported that their parents wanted to know about their sexual activity, particularly parents of females. A couple of participants reported voluntarily telling their parents about their sexual activity.
Birth Control and Contraceptives: Parents discussed condoms and contraceptives, but moreso with females than with males. Usually, however, these conversations did not get much more specific than something like "use a condom". Some parents made condoms available to their children, and some acknowledged that they knew their child would have sex, so they just wanted them to "wrap it up".
Abstinence/Delaying Sexual Activity: Both male and female focus groups discussed how their parents recommended abstinence, many recommending that they wait at least until marriage.
Parents' Personal Experiences: Parents shared their personal experiences more often with females than with males. They typically shared experiences that they felt the child could learn a lesson from, like how to avoid a mistake they made, or to know that love is something that is rare and worth appreciating.
Communication Style: Five communication styles emerged.

Closed communication: This is what the majority of students (male and female) experienced. Parents approached the child about sexual topics, but did not confer helpful info, and did so infrequently, without valuing the child as a contributor to the conversation.
Absent Communication: This was discussed nearly as frequently as closed communication, but was reported mostly by females. Parents either refused to communicate about sex or just avoided it entirely.
Open Communication: This was the least common form of communication, but it was also the one that participants appreciated the most. Open communication is characterized by reciprocity, ongoing discussion, and a focusing on addressing the needs of adolescents. These participants felt supported and educated by their parents, and was equally common across male and female groups.
Scare Tactics: This was fairly common. Parents made their kids feel afraid of STIs, the wrath of God, accidental pregnancy, etc. Scare tactics were more common in male groups than female groups.
Awkwardness: Those who reported that they didn't engage in PCSC due to awkwardness also were the ones to report closed communication and the use of scare tactics. Equally common for males and females.


Values: "Although participants who had experienced PCSC were not asked explicitly about the values their parents communicated, certain parental values were reflected in participants' responses."

Accepting Values: Values associated with acceptance of sexual activity and/or behaviours during adolescence. Many participants felt their parents had these values despite a lack of open communication. Accepting parents acknowledged their children would have sex, but encouraged them to do it safely. These values were equally common for males and females.
Conservative Values: These values were more commonly experienced by females than by males. Conservative parents emphasized that sex was, in some sense, morally degrading. When these kids would attempt to talk to their parents about sex, the parents would become angry, and express disappointment, shock, and sadness. This made it very hard for kids to discuss sexuality, and some reported attempting to discuss it but dropping the conversation b/c of their parent's response. Conservative values were also associated with homonegativity and a refusal to talk about birth control (even for the sake of controlling periods) b/c parents feared that talk of birth control would encourage sexual activity.


Suggestions for Improvements of PCSC:

Support and Openness: More common for females than for males. Participants wanted their parents to be more open to talk about sex, and also more open to the children having their own say in the conversation.
Same-Gender Communication Preferred: Overall, for both males and females, participants preferred to talk about sex with their parent of the same gender. They felt their same-gender parent was more relateable and would have a better understanding of the child's experiences. A very tiny minority said they either preferred talking to the opposite gender parent or were just as open to it.
Share Parents' Personal Experiences: Mostly female participants. Desire to hear parents' personal experiences, particularly around sexual decision-making, relationships, and activity rather than particular behaviours. They felt this would make them feel more comfortable in their own sexual lives.
Earlier Communication: Both male and female participants wanted earlier and ongoing sexual communication, most wanting it to begin in middle school, and most deeming high school to be too late (largely b/c by high school, they're already having sex).
Keeping the Status Quo: For both male and female groups, several participants didn't want anything changed about their PCSC. Several participants reported not wanting change. Of those in open or closed communication styles, they believed it was satisfactory. Of those with closed or absent communication styles, many reported gratitude that they were avoiding the awkwardness associated with PCSC.
No Scare Tactics: Both male and female participants denounced scare tactics as ineffective, and said that they need to be abolished in favour of teaching the children.





 
********************
DISCUSSION
********************

Basic summary of results:

Most salient topics in typical PCSC: Adolescents' sexual history/activity, birth control/contraceptives, abstinence or delaying sex, and parents' personal experiences.
Participants reported closed communication style w/parents, characterized by infrequent and one-sided conversations dominated by the parent.
Parents overall communicated accepting values.
Most common suggestion for improvement was to have supportive and open PCSC; children must be able to go to their parents for info and support regardless of sexual decisions.
Gender differences across some subthemes.


Breakdown by research question:

RQ1, Topics of PCSC: Adolescent sexual activity, birth control and contraceptives, abstinence/waiting to have sex, and parents' personal experiences.

Parents didn't discuss medical facts or health info regarding sexuality. Rather, they focused on messages that could influence the child's behaviour.
Females got more discussion on sexual activity, birth control and contraceptives, and parents' personal experiences.


RQ2, Communication Style: Most common style was closed communication, characterized by directives and dismissal of the child's input.

Parents often use scare tactics.
Awkwardness.
No gender differences in communication style, except that males get more scare tactics (particularly regarding unwanted pregnancy).


RQ3, Values Communicated in PCSC: Accepting values were more common and implicated less restriction on adolescent sexual behaviour. But conservative values did occur.

Females receive more conservative values than males.


RQ4: Suggestions for Improving PCSC: Participants wanted open and support PCSC.

Requests for open PCSC more common for females.
Participants refer same-gender PCSC (especially females).

There is research suggesting that opposite-gender PCSC is good for females (less sexual risk and more dyadic sexual communication w/partner) and males.
Work must be done, then, to decrease the awkwardness of opposite-gender PCSC.


Preference for PCSC to start earlier, and to include discussions of emotional/relational aspects of sex, parents' personal stories, and information regarding access to birth control.
Some participants preferred to avoid PCSC altogether, but this appears to be b/c of a fear of awkwardness.




Implications:

Parents should avoid scare tactics so they can better connect w/their child instead of shutting down discussion.
Parents' personal stories may be useful, particularly for teaching important lessons.
Open and supportive communication should be preferred over lecturing or threatening.
Many parents offered incorrect medical info about sex, so kids should get this from school instead. School should supplement PCSC.
Educational programs on PCSC must be offered for parents. Should be focused on preventing awkwardness and moralizing.

Often, learned sexual shame and guilt play a role in inhibiting sexual communication with partners. Early messages about sex from parents that stem from narrow cultural boundaries of communication may play a role in fostering sexual shame and guilt from a young age, potentially influencing sexual communication patterns with partners later on. This study seeks to identify whether a significant relationship exists between participants’ past parent-child sexual communication growing up and sexual communication satisfaction, relational satisfaction, and sexual satisfaction with current partners. ANOVA analyses revealed greater reported sex guilt among males and highly religious participants. Correlation and regression analyses yielded significant, positive relationships between former parent-child communication quality and current young adult sexual satisfaction with partner. A surprising result was a positive relationship between parent-child communication quality and sex guilt which warrants further research. Clinical implications and research directions are discussed for increasing open parent-child sex communication.},

The campaign follows a theoretical framework that identifies cognitions that are targeted in campaign messages and theorized to influence parent-child communication. While a previous experimental study showed PSUNC messages to be effective in increasing parent-child communication, it did not address how these effects manifest through the PSUNC theoretical framework. The current study examines the PSUNC theoretical framework by 1) estimating the impact of PSUNC on specific cognitions identified in the theoretical framework and 2) examining whether those cognitions are indeed associated with parent-child communication},

Parent-child sex communication’s potential to curb negative sexual health outcomes has sustained a multidisciplinary effort to better understand the process and its impact on the development of healthy sexual attitudes and behaviors among adolescents. This review advances what is known about the process of sex communication in the U.S. by reviewing studies published from 2003 to 2015. We used CINAHL, PsycInfo and Pubmed, the key-terms “parent child” AND “sex education” for the initial query; we included 116 original articles for analysis. Our review underscores long-established factors that prevent parents from effectively broaching and sustaining talks about sex with their children and has also identified emerging concerns unique to today’s parenting landscape. Parental factors salient to sex communication are established long before individuals become parents and are acted upon by influences beyond the home. Child-focused communication factors likewise describe a maturing audience that is far from captive. The identification of both enduring and emerging factors that affect how sex communication occurs will inform subsequent work that will result in more positive sexual health outcomes for adolescents.},

	abstract = {All individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) have the right to develop and express sexuality in an emotionally satisfying and socially appropriate manner. Questions have arisen as to whether sexuality education for this population should be the responsibility of the school or the family. This study looked to evaluate the role of the parents as the primary sexuality educators for their adolescents with Down syndrome (DS). This is because parents of children with DS report they want to be the primary sexuality educators for their children, but often overlook the responsibility because they do not know what to talk about, when to talk about it, or how to modify content so their child will understand. Previous research has shown that parents of typically developing children have an increase in self-efficacy talking about sexuality topics after attending a workshop. However, there is no such research for parents of individuals with I/DD generally, or DS specifically. In order to address the lack of formal parent education on sexuality and healthy relationships for individuals with I/DD, the Home B.A.S.E. for Developmental Disabilities workshop was designed utilizing principles of adult learning and social learning theories. There were 13 participants that completed the training. A small sample study assessing the effectiveness of the curriculum was carried out using a parallel mixed methods design. In addition to assessing the curriculum’s effectiveness, parental concerns that often inhibit teaching were collected.
The data supports that the Home B.A.S.E. for Developmental Disabilities curriculum has a large effect on increasing parent confidence and comfort initiating sexuality discussions and communicating about sexuality topics generally with their adolescents with DS. Parent attitudes surrounding sensitive sexuality topics can be transformed leading to more direct and open communication between parents and their children with DS. As a result of the training, parents reported they felt less of a need for additional information on all sexuality topics in order to effectively communicate with their child with DS, they understood the importance of direct and open communication, and they felt better prepared and aware of available resources.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12889-020-09218-y},
	abstract = {Background: 
Parent-child communication about sexual issues can reduce risky sexual behaviour amongst adolescents. Risky sexual behaviour is of concern in sub-Saharan Africa where the prevalence of early pregnancy, unsafe abortion and HIV are high. Parent-child communication about sexual issues presents a feasible approach for reducing sexual risk amongst adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa but limited research exists from the region. This study from Zambia examines the sociodemographic and psychosocial factors that are associated with whether parents communicate with their daughters about sexual issues.

Methods:
Data from a cluster randomized controlled trial examining the effect of interventions aiming to reduce teenage pregnancy and school drop out in Zambia was used. The data was collected between January-July in 2018 and consists of structured, face to face interviews with 4343 adolescent girls and 3878 parents. Cross sectional analyses examined the associations between parent-child communication about sexual issues and sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics using univariate and multivariable logistic regression models.

Results:
Adolescent girls who felt connected to their parents and those who perceived their parents to be comfortable in communicating about sex, were more likely to speak to their parents about sexual issues than those who did not (AOR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.01-1.52; and AOR 2.94, 95\% CI 2.45-3.54, respectively). Girls whose parents used fear-based communication about sexual issues, and those who perceived their parents as being opposed to education about contraception, were less likely to communicate with their parents about sex than those who did not (AOR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.65-0.89; and AOR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.63-0.91, respectively). Girls enrolled in school were less likely to communicate with their parents about sex than those out of school (AOR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.44-0.71).

Conclusion:
Parenting style, children's perception of parental attitudes and parental communication styles are associated with whether parents and children communicate about sexual issues. This may imply that parents can improve the chances of communicating with their children about sex by conveying non-judgemental attitudes, using open communication styles with neutral messages and appearing comfortable whilst displaying positive attitudes towards communication around sex and contraceptive use.

The results showed that disgust sensitivity was positively correlated with negative attitudes toward homosexuality, and positively correlated with moral concerns in five domains (care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity). Authority and sanctity were both associated with attitudes toward homosexuality, while only sanctity mediated the relationship between disgust sensitivity and attitudes toward homosexuality. Overall, the results suggest that considering moral foundations (especially sanctity) may lend more insight to the associations between disgust sensitivity and negative attitudes toward gay and lesbian people.},

The program is implemented in a high-stakes context where the ethnic composition in schools has changed due to a massive inﬂux of refugee children.

The program also reduces the likelihood of social exclusion and increases inter-ethnic social ties in the classroom.

Abstract


The “effective preparation period” (i.e., the period in which people prepare their attention) is commonly identified with the “foreperiod” (FP), which is the time between the disappearance of a cue/warning stimulus (S1) and the appearance of a target stimulus (S2).


However, the effective preparation period may actually begin prior to the foreperiod, like as soon as S1 is presented.


In a series of experiments, this study manipulated 2 variables:


Foreperiod (FP): The length of the period between the disappearence of S1 and the appearance of S2.


S1-duration: The amount of time that S1 is present.


S2-luminance: How brightly S2 appears as a target.


Stimulus-response compatibility.




The purpose was to examine the temporal properties of the effective preparation period outside of FP (as it is classically defined).


Result: Nonspecific preparation . . .


Begins at the onset of S1 for brief FPs, but begins at the offset for long FPs.


Continues in parallel with S2-encoding but stops prior to response selection.




Introduction


Experimental psychologists study preparation by giving people a warning cue and then a target to respond to. They analyze preparation in terms of mean reaction time (RT), plotted up against the amount of time between the warning cue/stimulus (S1) and the target stimulus (S2).


Preparation function: Reaction time as a function of either foreperiod (FP; time between S1 offset and S2 onset) or stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA; time between S1 onset and S2 onset).


The preparation function is ambiguous as to whether the effective preparation period begins at the onset or offset of S1, or somewhere in between, and does not demonstrate where the preparation period ends.





Preliminary distinctions and assumptions


Specific vs nonspecific preparation: Specific preparation is enabled when S1 is informative as to the response stimulus, whether it indicates target identity, probability, etc. Nonspecific preparation occurs when S1 is uninformative as to the response stimulus.


Specific preparation is assumed to reduce the computational complexity of response to S2.


Nonspecific preparation is assumed not to reduce the computational complexity of response, but instead merely increases alertness.




The present study focuses on nonspecific preparation, which permits for two main assumptions:


First, an increase in alertness via nonspecific preparation either speeds up computation of the response to S2, or lowers the criterion for activating computation of S2.


Second, nonspecific preparation is noncomputational. Therefore, reaction and preparation are mutually noncontingent – i.e., neither relies on the other to occur. So it is possible to experimentally separate reaction and nonspecific preparation without worrying that they’re computationally overlapping.





The effective preparation period





When does preparation start?


Unclear whether preparation begins at S1-on or S1-off. It could be both, depending on the circumstance.


Hypothesis: Specifically, they hypothesized that preparation would begin at either S1-on or S1-off depending on:


Which marker is a more reliable predictor of the onset of S2.


Which marker appears at an interval that is long enough to allow appropriate preparation, but short enough so that the prepatory state doesn’t dissipate over time.






When does preparation end?


Serial view of preparation: The claim that the effective preparation period ends upon presentation of S2. This view is a logical consequent of the claim that the effective preparation period is the foreperiod.


Alternative parallel view of preparation: Preparation continues after S2, until the process drawing on preparation (process Y in Fig. 1) begins operating on the input delivered by the predecessor process (process X). Therefore, preparation continues until S2 encoding is terminated.


Edited version of Figure 1 to clarify these views:





Theoretical justification for parallel view:


If reaction and preparation are mutually noncontingent, then they ought to be able to co-occur. But the serial view implies that they are mutually contingent, such that reaction can only occur upon the completion of preparation.


The authors believe that the empirical evidence for parallel processing is on their side.










Experimental approach


Hypotheses:


“the effective preparation period starts either at the onset or at the offset of S1, depending on the duration of FP, and lasts at least until S2 encoding has terminated.” (26).




The basic idea of the experiment is this: under what conditions can the same state of effective preparation be activated? If there are multiple sets of conditions under which this preparation period can be activated in the same manner, than those conditions are said to be psychologically equivalent.


The two variables used to define these conditions are:


Foreperiod


Other variables across the four experiments that lengthened effective preparation prior to FP:


Experiments 1 \& 2: S1 duration


Experiments 3 \& 4: S2 luminance and stimulus-response compatibility




If changing the additional variable, G, from G1 to G2 leads to an increase of the effective preparation by D ms, then the prepatory state in condition (G1, FPi) should be equivalent to that in (G2, FPi - D ms).






There were six levels of FP to test for equivalence conditions for RT-FP. Furthermore, the additional variable had two conditions, for a total of 12 (6 x 2) factors.



Experiment 1


Manipulations:


FP: Ranged from 0-250 ms


S1 duration: Either 50 or 150 ms


S1 onset and offset equally reliable predictors for S2 onset.






Prediction: Given that S1 duration and FP are very brief, S1 onset will be a more efficient time marker for S2 onset. Therefore, when the preparation function is written in terms of SOA, the functions will be equivalent for both S1 durations. But they will not be equivalent when written in terms of FP.


Methods


N = 12


Stimuli:


S1 = auditory tone


S2 = white square presented to the left or right of a vertical bar at the center of the screen




Procedure:


S1 presents for either 50 or 150 ms


S1 offset followed by FP of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 ms


S2 onset equally probable at left or right position relative to vertical bar


Participants press left or right SHIFT key depending on which side the white box (S2) appears on


After each block (total of 12 blocks across 2 sessions), participants were given their RT and accuracy scores to write down and keep track of their performance.




Results





Fig. 2A: Significant main effect of S1 duration, along with interaction between S1 duration and FP. For S1 duration of 50 ms, participants get faster as FP increases. For S1 duration of 150 ms, participants get slower as FP increases.


Fig. 2B: Marginally significant main effect of S1 duration. Not significant main effect of SOA nor interaction of SOA with S1 duration.


Fig. 2C: Marginally significant interaction between S1 and FP. More errors for FP ≤ 100 ms for S1 = 150 ms.


Fig. 2D: No effects approached significance.




Discussion


When the preparation interval is expressed in terms of SOA, the mean RTs are equivalent (Fig. 2B) whereas they are not when it is expressed in terms of FP (Fig. 2A). The error rates are also more similar when expressed in SOA (Fig. 2D).


Therefore, preparation is triggered by S1-onset when FPs and S1-durations are very brief.





Experiment 2


Manipulations:


Same as Experiment 1, except that they tried a longer S1 duration and some different FPs.


S1 durations: 50 ms \& 650 ms


FPs: ranging frmo 600 to 2100 ms


Unlike in Experiment 1, the shortest FP of 600 ms is considerably longer and therefore past the 250-300 ms preparation interval. So, the offset of S1 should be a more efficient trigger of preparation than onset.




Prediction: The preparation function for the two FPs ought to be equivalent when RT is expressed in terms of FP but not when expressed in terms of SOA.




Results





Fig. 3A: Significant main effect of FP; RT increases as FP increases. Unlike Experiment 1, no significant main effect of S1 duration nor interaction between FP and S1 duration.


Fig. 3B: Significant main effect of SOA. Significant main effect of S1 duration. No significant interaction between SOA and S1 duration.


Fig. 3C \& 3D: No significant effects on error rates.





Discussion


When FPs and S1 durations are relatively long, the preparation functions of both S1 duration conditions are equivalent when expressed as a function of FP but not of SOA.


In the context of relatively long FPs, preparation is triggered by the offset of S1.


Experiments 1 and 2 confirmed the hypothesis that preparation is flexibly triggered by the onset or offset of S1, depending on the length of FPs and S1 durations.


An underadditive-factor method


The first sections of this paper focused on the beginning of the preparation period. Now it will focus on the end.


Additive factor method: “Two factors exhibit additive effects if (1) processes are arranged in stages (i.e., as epochs without temporal overlap), and (2) the factors influence these processes selectively in that they do not influence a common process. If either of these conditions is not met, the factors are likely to exhibit an interaction effect.” (32).


I.e., factors are additive when they don’t occur simultaneously and they don’t affect a common process.


The additive factor method is invalid for a parallel view of preparation, because parallel processing implies a violation of premise 1, that processes are arranged in stages.




Additive factor method applied to preparation: Assume that FP influences process Y, and G influences either X, Y, or Z. Further assume the serial view, such that processes X, Y, and Z (as well as preparation) do not share temporal overlap. 


If G influences either process X or Z but not Y, then FP and G would exhibit additive effects. 


Denial of the consequent implies that FP and G are interactive, and so G influences Y. 




If G influences process Y, then FP and G would probably interact. 


Denial of the consequent implies that G doesn’t influence process Y. 






Underadditive factor method applied to preparation: The serial view makes predictions consistent with the additive factor method, but the parallel view does not because factors can share temporal overlap without interacting. Given that we have reason to believe the parallel view (Experiment 1), we must apply the underadditive method. 


Suppose that X involves encoding, Y involves deciding, and Z involves responding, as the three components of the reaction process. Further assume that preparation occurs parallel to encoding. 







In Fig. 4, A1 and A2, we have an underadditive interaction: G influences some process X, causing it to lengthen. The lengthening of X shortens Y by increasing the supply of preparation. Thus, there is a tradeoff between X and Y, such that an increase in X implies a decrease in Y. This tradeoff effect would is underadditive because it would be bigger for short FPs (cases where the supply of preparation is low and the demand is high; G increases supply, thereby having a smaller overall effect) than for long FPs (cases where the supply of preparation is high and the demand is low; G increases supply, thereby having a larger overall effect by dragging X out further than necessary). 


For the underadditive interaction, we have an especially powerful inferential tool. If G has an effect of D ms on process X, then it will have a twofold effect on the RT-FP function: 


First, by lengthening the serial component (process X) of the reaction process by D ms, it will lift the RT-FP function D ms upward. 


Second, by lengthening the duration of the effective preparation period by D ms, it will shift the RT-FP function D ms to the left. So, we obtain the following equivalence condition: 


Equivalence condition: RT(G1, FPi) = RT(G2, FPi - D) - D
















Experiment 3


Experiment 3 tested the serial and parallel views by using FP and S2 luminance as factors. 


Stimulus luminance influences early encoding processes, according to prior research. 


Preparation influences processes beyond encoding, according to prior research. 


Therefore, if the serial view is true, then the effect relation between FP and S2 should be additive. But if the parallel view is true, it should be an underadditive interaction. 




Method


S2 could be either bright or dim. S1 remained constant both in luminance and in presentation time. 


Results





As seen in Fig. 5A, the interaction is underadditive: the effect of luminance was larger for long FPs than for short FPs. 





Fig. 5A indicates that preparation continues during encoding (X). To test this, they used their equivalence condition: 





They took both S2 bright and dim at their lower bound values (FP{\textgreater}150 ms) and estimated D = 74 ms (the average D at that point onwards). They then shifted the response times of the dim condition accordingly, and plotted their coordinates with the bright condition to see if they correlated – and they did! 


Therefore, you can describe all these data points in terms of FP with an exponential decay function, without invoking S2 luminance – that’s the point of an equivalence condition. Nice. 






Discussion


This experiment showed a strong underadditive interaction between S2 luminance and FP. Therefore, preparation continues unimpeded during S2 encoding (process X). 


Experiment 4


Experiment 1 showed that preparation occurs at S1 onset when S1 and FP are brief, and at S1 offset when FP is long. 


Experiment 3 showed that preparation continues parallel to (during) process X. 


Experiment 4 will test whether preparation continues past process X, into later processes. 


To test preparation in E4, they manipulated stimulus-response compatibility (SRC): 


Compatible condition: Locations of S2 and the correct response key were spatially congruent. 


Incompatible condition: Locations of S2 and the correct response key were spatially incongruent. 




SRC influences the duration of the response-selection process, according to past research. 


This is also a replication of Poster et al (1971; Experiment 1), who found data trending towards an underadditive interaction for SRC, but did not approach significance. 


Method


S2 luminance fixed at bright level instead of varying as in E3. 


SRC was either compatible or incompatible. 





FP and SRC were purely additive, in stark contrast to E3. The equivalence function showed they are, in fact, equivalent – they’re just additive rather than interactive functions. 




Discussion


The effects of FP and SRC on RT combined additively. 


Therefore, preparation continues in parallel with S2-encoding, but stops prior to response selection.

Contrary to the widely accepted notion that temporal cortex processing primarily focusses on passive object recognition, a series of very recent studies emphasize the role of temporal cortex structures, specifically the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and inferotemporal (IT) cortex, in guiding attention and implementing cognitive programs relevant for behavioral tasks. The goal of this theo­ retical paper is to advance the hypothesis that the temporal cortex attention network (TAN) entails necessary components to actively participate in attentional control in a flexible task-dependent manner. First, we will briefly discuss the general architecture of the temporal cortex with a focus on the STS and IT cortex of monkeys and their modulation with attention. Then we will review evidence from behavioral and neurophysiological studies that support their guidance of attention in the presence of cognitive control signals. Next, we propose a mechanistic framework for executive control of attention in the temporal cortex. Finally, we summarize the role of temporal cortex in implementing cognitive programs and discuss how they contribute to the dynamic nature of visual attention to ensure flexible behavior.},

	abstract = {Human eye-gaze is a powerful stimulus, drawing the observer's attention to places and objects of interest to someone else (‘eye-gaze following’). The largely homogeneous eyes of monkeys, compromising the assessment of eye-gaze by conspecifics from larger distances, explain the absence of comparable eye-gaze following in these animals. Yet, monkeys are able to use peer head orientation to shift attention (‘head-gaze following’). How similar are monkeys' head-gaze and human eye-gaze following? To address this question, we trained rhesus monkeys to make saccades to targets, either identified by the head-gaze of demonstrator monkeys or, alternatively, identified by learned associations between the demonstrators' facial identities and the targets (gaze versus identity following). In a variant of this task that occurred at random, the instruction to follow head-gaze or identity was replaced in the course of a trial by the new rule to detect a change of luminance of one of the saccade targets. Although this change-of-rule rendered the demonstrator portraits irrelevant, they nevertheless influenced performance, reflecting a precise redistribution of spatial attention. The specific features depended on whether the initial rule was head-gaze or identity following: head-gaze caused an insuppressible shift of attention to the target gazed at by the demonstrator, whereas identity matching prompted much later shifts of attention, however, only if the initial rule had been identity following. Furthermore, shifts of attention prompted by head-gaze were spatially precise. Automaticity and swiftness, spatial precision and limited executive control characterizing monkeys' head-gaze following are key features of human eye-gaze following. This similarity supports the notion that both may rely on the same conserved neural circuitry.},

	abstract = {In this article, we challenge the usefulness of “attention” as a unitary construct and/or neural system. We point out that the concept has too many meanings to justify a single term, and that “attention” is used to refer to both the explanandum (the set of phenomena in need of explanation) and the explanans (the set of processes doing the explaining). To illustrate these points, we focus our discussion on visual selective attention. It is argued that selectivity in processing has emerged through evolution as a design feature of a complex multi-channel sensorimotor system, which generates selective phenomena of “attention” as one of many by-products. Instead of the traditional analytic approach to attention, we suggest a synthetic approach that starts with well-understood mechanisms that do not need to be dedicated to attention, and yet account for the selectivity phenomena under investigation. We conclude that what would serve scientific progress best would be to drop the term “attention” as a label for a specific functional or neural system and instead focus on behaviorally relevant selection processes and the many systems that implement them.},

	abstract = {Prominent models of attentional control assert a dichotomy between top-down and bottom-up control, with the former determined by current selection goals and the latter determined by physical salience. This theoretical dichotomy, however, fails to explain a growing number of cases in which neither current goals nor physical salience can account for strong selection biases. For example, equally salient stimuli associated with reward can capture attention, even when this contradicts current selection goals. Thus, although ‘top-down’ sources of bias are sometimes defined as those that are not due to physical salience, this conception conflates distinct – and sometimes contradictory – sources of selection bias. We describe an alternative framework, in which past selection history is integrated with current goals and physical salience to shape an integrated priority map.},

	abstract = {Background: Anxiety and related disorders are among the most common mental disorders, with lifetime prevalence reportedly as high as 31\%. Unfortunately, anxiety disorders are under-diagnosed and under-treated.
Methods: These guidelines were developed by Canadian experts in anxiety and related disorders through a consensus process. Data on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment (psychological and pharmacological) were obtained through MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and manual searches (1980–2012). Treatment strategies were rated on strength of evidence, and a clinical recommendation for each intervention was made, based on global impression of efficacy, effectiveness, and side effects, using a modified version of the periodic health examination guidelines.
Results: These guidelines are presented in 10 sections, including an introduction, principles of diagnosis and management, six sections (Sections 3 through 8) on the specific anxiety-related disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder), and two additional sections on special populations (children/adolescents, pregnant/lactating women, and the elderly) and clinical issues in patients with comorbid conditions.
Conclusions: Anxiety and related disorders are very common in clinical practice, and frequently comorbid with other psychiatric and medical conditions. Optimal management requires a good understanding of the efficacy and side effect profiles of pharmacological and psychological treatments.},

Several individual, familial, and environmental risk factors for adverse course characteristics of anxiety disorders (including higher persistence, lower probability of remission, and increased risk of recurrence) have been identified, and previous research suggests that clinical features of anxiety (e.g., higher severity, duration, and avoidance) as well as comorbid other mental disorders are particularly useful for predicting an unfavorable course of anxiety disorders. However, additional studies are needed to identify risk factors for individual course trajectories of anxiety disorders in general as well as specific diagnoses. Doing so is essential in order to more precisely identify individuals with anxiety disorders who are at increased risk for adverse long-term outcomes and might thus particularly profit from targeted early interventions.},

	doi = {10.1097/CHI.0b013e318179964f},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Autism spectrum disorders are now recognized to occur in up to 1\% of the population and to be a major public health concern because of their early onset, lifelong persistence, and high levels of associated impairment. Little is known about the associated psychiatric disorders that may contribute to impairment. We identify the rates and type of psychiatric comorbidity associated with ASDs and explore the associations with variables identified as risk factors for child psychiatric disorders.
METHOD: A subgroup of 112 ten- to 14-year old children from a population-derived cohort was assessed for other child psychiatric disorders (3 months' prevalence) through parent interview using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment. DSM-IV diagnoses for childhood anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, oppositional defiant and conduct disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, tic disorders, trichotillomania, enuresis, and encopresis were identified.
RESULTS: Seventy percent of participants had at least one comorbid disorder and 41\% had two or more. The most common diagnoses were social anxiety disorder (29.2\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI)] 13.2-45.1), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (28.2\%, 95\% CI 13.3-43.0), and oppositional defiant disorder (28.1\%, 95\% CI 13.9-42.2). Of those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 84\% received a second comorbid diagnosis. There were few associations between putative risk factors and psychiatric disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric disorders are common and frequently multiple in children with autism spectrum disorders. They may provide targets for intervention and should be routinely evaluated in the clinical assessment of this group.},

	abstract = {Recent studies support several overlapping traits between autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), assuming the existence of a combined phenotype. The aim of our study was to evaluate the common or distinctive clinical features between ASD and ADHD in order to identify possible different phenotypes that could have a clinical value. We enrolled 181 subjects divided into four diagnostic groups: ADHD group, ASD group, ASD+ADHD group (that met diagnostic criteria for both ASD and ADHD), and control group. Intelligent quotient (IQ), emotional and behavior problems, ADHD symptoms, ASD symptoms, and adaptive behaviors were investigated through the following test: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence or Leiter International Performances Scale Revised, Child Behavior Checklist, Conners' Rating Scales-Revised, SNAP-IV Rating Scale, the Social Communication Questionnaire, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. The ASD+ADHD group differs from ADHD or ASD in some domains such as lower IQ mean level and a higher autistic symptoms severity. However, the ASD+ADHD group shares inattention and hyperactivity deficit and some emotional and behavior problems with the ADHD group, while it shares adaptive behavior impairment with ASD group. These findings provide a new understanding of clinical manifestation of ASD+ADHD phenotype, they may also inform a novel treatment target.

	abstract = {Mental health professionals typically encounter patients at 1 point in patients’ lives. This cross-sectional window understandably fosters focus on the current presenting diagnosis. Research programs, treatment protocols, specialist clinics, and specialist journals are oriented to presenting diagnoses, on the assumption that diagnosis informs about causes and prognosis. This study tests an alternative hypothesis: people with mental disorders experience many different kinds of disorders across diagnostic families, when followed for 4 decades.To describe mental disorder life histories across the first half of the life course.This cohort study involved participants born in New Zealand from 1972 to 1973 who were enrolled in the population-representative Dunedin Study. Participants were observed from birth to age 45 years (until April 2019). Data were analyzed from May 2019 to January 2020.Diagnosed impairing disorders were assessed 9 times from ages 11 to 45 years. Brain function was assessed through neurocognitive examinations conducted at age 3 years, neuropsychological testing during childhood and adulthood, and midlife neuroimaging-based brain age.Of 1037 original participants (535 male [51.6\%]), 1013 had mental health data available. The proportions of participants meeting the criteria for a mental disorder were as follows: 35\% (346 of 975) at ages 11 to 15 years, 50\% (473 of 941) at age 18 years, 51\% (489 of 961) at age 21 years, 48\% (472 of 977) at age 26 years, 46\% (444 of 969) at age 32 years, 45\% (429 of 955) at age 38 years, and 44\% (407 of 927) at age 45 years. The onset of the disorder occurred by adolescence for 59\% of participants (600 of 1013), eventually affecting 86\% of the cohort (869 of 1013) by midlife. By age 45 years, 85\% of participants (737 of 869) with a disorder had accumulated comorbid diagnoses. Participants with adolescent-onset disorders subsequently presented with disorders at more past-year assessments (r = 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.68 to 0.74; P \&lt; .001) and met the criteria for more diverse disorders (r = 0.64; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.67; P \&lt; .001). Confirmatory factor analysis summarizing mental disorder life histories across 4 decades identified a general factor of psychopathology, the p-factor. Longitudinal analyses showed that high p-factor scores (indicating extensive mental disorder life histories) were antedated by poor neurocognitive functioning at age 3 years (r = −0.18; 95\% CI, −0.24 to −0.12; P \&lt; .001), were accompanied by childhood-to-adulthood cognitive decline (r = −0.11; 95\% CI, −0.17 to −0.04; P \&lt; .001), and were associated with older brain age at midlife (r = 0.14; 95\% CI, 0.07 to 0.20; P \&lt; .001).These findings suggest that mental disorder life histories shift among different successive disorders. Data from the present study, alongside nationwide data from Danish health registers, inform a life-course perspective on mental disorders. This perspective cautions against overreliance on diagnosis-specific research and clinical protocols.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, evidence-based medicine has become one of the foundations of clinical practice, making it necessary that healthcare practitioners develop keen critical appraisal skills for scientific papers. Worksheets to guide clinicians through this critical appraisal are often used in journal clubs, a key part of continuing medical education. A similar need is arising for health professionals to develop skills in the critical appraisal of medical ethics papers. Medicine is increasingly ethically complex, and there is a growing medical ethics literature that modern practitioners need to be able to use in their practice. In addition, clinical ethics services are commonplace in healthcare institutions, and the lion’s share of the work done by these services is done by clinicians in addition to their usual roles. Education to support this work is important. In this paper, we present a worksheet designed to help busy healthcare practitioners critically appraise ethics papers relevant to clinical practice. In the first section, we explain what is different about ethics papers. We then describe how to work through the steps in our critical appraisal worksheet: identifying the point at issue; scrutinising definitions; dissecting the arguments presented; considering counterarguments; and finally deciding on relevance. Working through this reflective worksheet will help healthcare practitioners to use the ethics literature effectively in clinical practice. We also intend it to be a shared evaluative tool that can form the basis of professional discussion such as at ethics journal clubs. Practising these critical reasoning skills will also increase practitioners’ capacity to think through difficult ethical decisions in daily clinical practice.},

Additional research and more effective medications are desperately needed, but clinical trials research in mood disorders is fraught with ethical issues. Although many authors have discussed these issues, most do so from a theoretical viewpoint. This manuscript uses available empirical data to inform a discussion of the primary ethical issues raised in mood disorders research. These include issues of consent and decisionmaking capacity, including patients’ motivations for participating in research. We also address drug withdrawals, placebo controls, and the overall safety of research. Finally, we examine the extant literature for studies discussing potential indirect benefits of clinical trials research to participants. Taken together, the evidence suggests that clinical trials research incorporating drug withdrawals and placebo controls can be conducted safely and ethically, even in patients with severe or treatmentresistant mood disorders. In fact, given the dearth of effective treatment options for this population, it is our opinion that a moral imperative exists to extend the offer of research participation to severely ill or treatmentresistant groups.},

	abstract = {The concept of vulnerability is widely used in research ethics to signal attention to participants who require special protections in research. However, this concept is vague and under‐theorized. There is also growing concern that the dominant categorical approach to vulnerability (as exemplified by research ethics regulations and guidelines delineating vulnerable groups) is ethically problematic because of its assumptions about groups of people and is, in fact, not very guiding. An agreed‐upon strategy is to move from categorical towards analytical approaches (focused on analyzing types and sources of vulnerability) to vulnerability. Beyond this agreement, however, scholars have been advancing competing accounts of vulnerability without consensus about its appropriate operationalization in research ethics. Based on previous debates, we propose that a comprehensive account of vulnerability for research ethics must include four components: definition, normative justifications, application, and implications. Concluding that no existing accounts integrate these components in a functional (i.e., practically applicable) manner, we propose an integrative and functional account of vulnerability inspired by pragmatist theory and enriched by bioethics literature. Using an example of research on deep brain stimulation for treatment‐resistant depression, we illustrate how the integrative‐functional account can guide the analysis of vulnerability in research within a pragmatist, evidence‐based approach to research ethics. While ultimately there are concerns to be addressed in existing research ethics guidelines on vulnerability, the integrativefunctional account can serve as an analytic tool to help researchers, research ethics boards, and other relevant actors fill in the gaps in the current landscape of research ethics governance.},

	abstract = {"All-causes discontinuation" refers to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, and medication adherence is an important component of this measure. Similar to our previous results, we found that almost 30\% of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) discontinue medication in the first 9 months of treatment, a finding that has important implications for long-term outcomes. Many newer second-generation antipsychotics have not been studied in FEP. The self-reported Drug Attitude Inventory may help identify patients at heightened risk for medication discontinuation. In addition to vigilant monitoring for and adequate treatment of psychopathology and medication side effects, Relapse Prevention Therapy and the use of long-acting injectable agents may be effective interventions decrease discontinuation rates in FEP. There is currently no consensus on how long a patient should remain on an antipsychotic medication following remission of FEP. Studies are needed to identify predictors of which patients in remission from FEP are less likely to relapse when medication is discontinued. Taken together, our findings presented here underscore the importance of addressing medication discontinuation both as a means of preventing long-term morbidity and enhancing remission and functional recovery in FEP.},

	abstract = {Outcomes of psychotic disorders are associated with high personal, familiar, societal and clinical burden. There is thus an urgent clinical and societal need for improving those outcomes. Recent advances in research knowledge have opened new opportunities for ameliorating outcomes of psychosis during its early clinical stages. This paper critically reviews these opportunities, summarizing the state-of-the-art knowledge and focusing on recent discoveries and future avenues for first episode research and clinical interventions. Candidate targets for primary universal prevention of psychosis at the population level are discussed. Potentials offered by primary selective prevention in asymptomatic subgroups (stage 0) are presented. Achievements of primary selected prevention in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (stage 1) are summarized, along with challenges and limitations of its implementation in clinical practice. Early intervention and secondary prevention strategies at the time of a first episode of psychosis (stage 2) are critically discussed, with a particular focus on minimizing the duration of untreated psychosis, improving treatment response, increasing patients’ satisfaction with treatment, reducing illicit substance abuse and preventing relapses. Early intervention and tertiary prevention strategies at the time of an incomplete recovery (stage 3) are further discussed, in particular with respect to addressing treatment resistance, improving well-being and social skills with reduction of burden on the family, treatment of comorbid substance use, and prevention of multiple relapses and disease progression. In conclusion, to improve outcomes of a complex, heterogeneous syndrome such as psychosis, it is necessary to globally adopt complex models integrating a clinical staging framework and coordinated specialty care programmes that offer pre-emptive interventions to high-risk groups identified across the early stages of the disorder. Only a systematic implementation of these models of care in the national health care systems will render these strategies accessible to the 23 million people worldwide suffering from the most severe psychiatric disorders.},

In subgroup analyses, risk difference of relapse was lower in studies with a longer follow-up period, a targeted discontinuation strategy, a higher relapse threshold, a larger sample size, and samples with patients excluded for drug or alcohol dependency. Insufficient studies included psychosocial functioning outcomes for a meta-analysis.ConclusionsThere is a higher risk of relapse for those who undergo total or targeted discontinuation strategies compared with maintenance antipsychotics in FEP samples.

	abstract = {In recent years, early intervention services have attempted to identify people with a first episode of psychosis as early as possible, reducing the duration of untreated psychosis and changing the timing of delivery of interventions. The logic of early intervention is based partly on accessing people in a more treatment responsive stage of illness in which psychosocial damage is less extensive, and partly on remediating a putatively active process of neuroprogression that leads to pathophysiological, symptomatic and structural changes, hence improving symptomatic and functional outcomes. However, as in other areas of health care, earlier identification of new patients may mean that different treatment approaches are indicated. The corollary of early detection is that the sequence and complexion of treatment strategies for first episode psychosis has been revaluated. Examples include the minimal effective dosage of antipsychotic medication and the content of psychosocial interventions. With the substantial reductions of DUP now seen in many early psychosis services, based on clinical staging and stepped care principles, it is even possible that the immediate introduction of antipsychotic medication may not be necessary for all first episode psychosis cases, but that potentially safer interventions, which may be more acceptable to many patients, such as comprehensive psychosocial intervention, may constitute effective treatment at least for a subgroup of patients. In this paper, we review this theoretical background and describe a randomised controlled trial currently underway at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) in Melbourne designed to test outcomes for first episode psychosis patients in response to two different treatments: intensive psychosocial intervention plus antipsychotic medication versus intensive psychosocial intervention plus placebo. This is a theoretically and pragmatically novel study in that it will provide evidence as to whether intensive psychosocial intervention alone is sufficient for a subgroup of first episode psychosis patients in a specialised early intervention service, and provide a test of the heuristic clinical staging model. By experimentally manipulating duration of untreated psychosis, the study will also provide a methodologically strong test of the effect of delaying the introduction of antipsychotic medication, as well as helping to disentangle the effects of antipsychotic medications and the putative neurobiological processes associated with brain changes and symptom profiles in the early phase of psychotic disorders. The study has been carefully crafted to satisfy critical ethical demands in this challenging research domain.},

	abstract = {Background
Clinical guidelines recommend maintenance treatment with antipsychotic medication for one to two years following remission of symptoms after a first episode of psychosis. However, recent research has suggested that this may not be indicated. Consistent predictors of outcome would be beneficial to guide clinicians as to which individuals are likely to have a successful discontinuation.
Objectives
This study reviews the literature with the aim of identifying demographic and clinical predictors of either relapse or continued remission in those with a first episode of psychosis following discontinuation of antipsychotic medication.
Methodology
Data Sources: A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, and PsychInfo databases was performed. Eligibility Criteria: Cohort, case-control and clinical trials that were published in English, included participants with a first episode of psychosis, and examined clinical and demographic predictors of relapse or continued remission after antipsychotic discontinuation.
Results
Eleven studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. No positive findings were replicated across cohorts. Predictors of relapse: male sex, unemployment, prior psychiatric admission, premorbid adjustment, childhood isolation, premorbid functioning, schizoid-schizotypal traits, schizophrenia diagnosis, concomitant medication, and more severe negative symptoms. Some positive findings must be interpreted in the context of conflicting and replicated negative findings: sex, employment status, level of education, premorbid functioning, symptom severity, and schizophrenia diagnosis. Other replicated non-predictive findings: age, ethnicity, marital status, family history, disorganized thoughts, affective symptoms, cannabis abuse, clinical global impression, social integration, duration and dose of antipsychotic treatment, and compliance.
Conclusion
No positive findings have been replicated across study cohorts. Non-predictive findings have been replicated.},

Forty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. The structural database comprised 965 FEP subjects matched with 1040 controls whilst the functional cohort included 362 FEP subjects matched with 403 controls. The analysis identified conjoint structural and functional differences in the insula/superior temporal gyrus and the medial frontal/anterior cingulate cortex bilaterally. In these regions, large and robust decreases in grey matter volume were found with either reduced or enhanced activation. Meta-regression analyses indicated that grey matter volume in the anterior cingulate and left insular clusters was influenced by exposure to antipsychotics: patients receiving medication were more likely to show structural abnormalities in these regions.},

Antipsychotic (AP)-induced weight gain is one modifiable factor in this period. The purpose of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis of AP-induced weight and body mass index (BMI) change in FEP. Methods A comprehensive literature search identified 28 articles that reported data on AP-specific weight or BMI change in FEP. We conducted a meta-analysis of short- and long-term mean weight and BMI differences between placebo and AP medications. We also performed subgroup and meta-regression analysis to examine weight, BMI outcomes and their relationship with location (Asian vs. Western), sponsorship and baseline weight and BMIs. Results Compared to placebo, AP-caused mean weight gain was 3.22 kg and 1.4 points BMI in the short-term, and 5.30 kg and 1.86 points BMI in the long term. Clinically significant weight gain risk increased about twofold with AP use. Weight gain was associated with duration of AP use. AP medications were associated with more weight gain in Western samples as opposed to Asian samples. Most AP medications were associated with significant body weight gain and BMI increase in FEP patients, except for ziprasidone. Olanzapine and clozapine caused the highest weight gain compared to placebo. Conclusion Except for ziprasidone, most AP medications were associated with body weight gain and BMI increase in FEP patients. Early and continuing effects of various AP medications on weight gain and BMI increase should be taken into consideration by clinicians.},

	abstract = {Objective: Alcohol and cannabis misuse are common in patients with early phase psychosis (EPP); however, research has tended to focus primarily on cannabis misuse and EPP outcomes, with a relative lack of data on alcohol misuse. This retrospective cross-sectional EPP study investigated the relationship between cannabis, alcohol, and cannabis combined with alcohol misuse, on age, gender, psychotic, depressive and anxiety symptom severity, and social/occupational functioning, at entry to service.
Methods: Two-hundred and sixty-four EPP patients were divided into 4 groups based on substance use measured by the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test: (1) no to low-level cannabis and alcohol misuse (LU), (2) moderate to high alcohol misuse only (AU), (3) moderate to high cannabis misuse only (CU), and (4) moderate to high alcohol and cannabis misuse (AU þ CU).
Results: We found significant between group differences in age (with the AU group being the oldest and AU þ CU group the youngest) as well as gender (with the CU group having the highest percentage of men). There were also group differences in positive psychotic symptoms (lowest in AU group), trait anxiety (highest in AU þ CU group), and social/occupational functioning (highest in AU group). Further regression analyses revealed a particularly strong relationship between AU þ CU group and trait anxiety (3-fold increased odds of clinical trait anxiety for combined misuse of alcohol and cannabis compared to non/low users).
Conclusions: This study demonstrates the unique demographic and clinical characteristics found in the EPP population at entry to care associated with alcohol and cannabis misuse both separately and in combination. This work highlights the importance of including the assessment of alcohol misuse in addition to cannabis misuse in future treatment guidelines and research.},

In addition, an electronic database and Internet search was conducted to find existing guidelines for EIS. Survey results were then compared with the existing expert recommendations.
Results: Most of the surveyed programs offer similar services, in line with published expert recommendations (i.e., easy and rapid access, intensive follow-up through case management with emphasis on patient engagement and continuity of care, and a range of integrated evidence-based psychosocial interventions). However, differences are observed among programs in admission and discharge criteria, services for patients at ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis, patient to clinician ratios, accessibility of services, and existence of specific inpatient units. These seem to diverge from expert recommendations.
Conclusions: Although Canadian programs are following most expert recommendations on clinical components of care, some programs lack administrative and organizational elements considered essential. Continued mentoring and networking of clinicians through organizations such as the Canadian Consortium for Early Intervention in Psychosis (CCEIP), as well as the development of a fidelity scale through further research, could possibly help programs attain and maintain the best standards of early intervention. However, simply making clinical guidelines available to care providers is not sufficient for changing practices; this will need to be accompanied by adequate funding and support from organizations and policy makers.},

	abstract = {Despite development of comprehensive approaches to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders and improve outcomes, there remains a proportion (approximately one-third) of patients who are treatment resistant and will not have remission of psychotic symptoms despite adequate trials of pharmacotherapy. This level of treatment response is stable across all stages of the spectrum of psychotic disorders, including early phase psychosis and chronic schizophrenia. Our current pharmacotherapies are beneﬁcial in decreasing positive symptomology in most cases, however, with little to no impact on negative or cognitive symptoms. Not all individuals with treatment resistant psychosis unfortunately, even beneﬁt from the potential pharmacological reductions in positive symptoms. The existing pharmacotherapy for psychosis is targeted at neurotransmitter receptors. The current ﬁrst and second generation antipsychotic medications all act on dopamine type 2 receptors with the second generation drugs also interacting signiﬁcantly with serotonin type 1 and 2 receptors, and with varying pharmacodynamic proﬁles overall. This focus on developing dopaminergic/serotonergic antipsychotics, while beneﬁcial, has not reduced the proportion of patients experiencing treatment resistance to date. Another pharmacological approach is imperative to address treatment resistance both for response overall and for negative symptoms in particular. There is research suggesting that changes in white matter integrity occur in schizophrenia and these may be more associated with cognition and even negative symptomology. Here we review the evidence that white matter abnormalities in the brain may be contributing to the symptomology of psychotic disorders. Additionally, we propose that white matter may be a viable pharmacological target for pharmacoresistant schizophrenia and discuss current treatments in development for schizophrenia that target white matter.},

	abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to compare an early behavioral intervention (EBI) with nonstructured standard physical care (routine care intervention [RCI]) in preventing antipsychotic-induced weight gain in drug-naive first-episode psychosis patients.
Method: Sixty-one patients with a DSM-IV–diagnosed psychotic disorder were first randomly assigned to 3 different antipsychotic treatments (risperidone [N = 23], olanzapine [N = 18], and haloperidol [N = 21]) and subsequently randomly assigned to the intervention condition (EBI, N = 35) or RCI (N = 27). EBI was specifically designed to teach strategies to enhance control over factors associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain and consisted of 8 flexible intervention modules that incorporated behavioral interventions, nutrition, and exercise. In the RCI group, patients were informed about potential weight gain and advised to increase their exercise and limit food intake. Body weight and body mass index were measured at baseline and then weekly for 3 months. In addition to change in weight and body mass index, a third outcome measure was the proportion of patients who had gained more than 7\% of their body weight at 3 months. Participating patients were referred between August 2002 and September 2004.
Results: All 61 participants completed the study. Patients in the EBI group gained significantly less weight (mean = 4.1 kg, SD = 4.0) than those allocated to the RCI group (mean = 6.9 kg, SD = 4.5) (p {\textless} .01) during the 3-month follow-up period. Similar findings were obtained when both groups were compared on treatment-induced change in body mass index, which was significantly less in the EBI group than in the RCI group (1.40 vs. 2.39 kg/m2) (p {\textless} .01). Accordingly, significantly fewer patients in the EBI group (N = 11; 39.3\%) than in the RCI group (N = 26; 78.8\%) (p {\textless} .002) increased their baseline weight by more than 7\%, the cutoff for clinically meaningful weight gain.
Conclusions: EBI was effective in attenuating antipsychotic-induced weight gain in a drug-naive first-episode psychosis cohort. Patients displayed good adherence to this type of preventive intervention. (J Clin Psychiatry 2006;67:1253–1260)},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This triple-blind (participants, clinicians, and researchers) randomized controlled noninferiority trial examined whether intensive psychosocial intervention (cognitive-behavioral case management, CBCM) for first-episode psychosis (FEP) in 15–25 year-olds managed in a specialized early intervention for psychosis service was noninferior to usual treatment of antipsychotic medication plus CBCM delivered during the first 6 months of treatment. To maximize safety, participants were required to have low levels of suicidality and aggression, a duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) of less than 6 months, and be living in stable accommodation with social support. The primary outcome was level of functioning as assessed by the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) at 6 months. Ninety young people were randomized by computer, 46 to placebo, and 44 antipsychotic medication and 33\% of those who commenced trial medication completed the entire 6-month trial period. On the SOFAS, both groups improved, and group differences were small and clinically trivial, indicating that treatment with placebo medication was no less effective than conventional antipsychotic treatment (mean difference = −0.2, 2-sided 95\% confidence interval = −7.5 to 7.0, t = 0.060, P = .95). Within the context of a specialized early intervention service, and with a short DUP, the immediate introduction of antipsychotic medication may not be required for all cases of FEP in order to see functional improvement. However, this finding can only be generalized to a very small proportion of FEP cases at this stage, and a larger trial is required to clarify whether antipsychotic-free treatment can be recommended for specific subgroups of those with FEP.

	abstract = {Background: In contrast to over 30 studies reporting neurotoxicity associated with the ﬁrst-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), several published studies have reported multiple neuroprotective effects associated with the second generation antipsychotics (SGAs). This prompted us to conduct a review of the reported neuroprotective mechanisms of the SGA class of antipsychotics compared to the FGAs.
Methods: A PubMed search was conducted using the keywords antipsychotic, neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, neurotoxicity, toxicity, brain volume, neuroinﬂammation, oxidative stress, myelin, and oligodendrocyte. No restrictions were placed on the date of the articles or language. Studies with a clearly described methodology were included.
Results: Animal, cell culture, and human clinical studies were identiﬁed. Twenty-four reports met the criteria for the search. All studies included at least one SGA (aripiprazole, clozapine, lurasidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, perospirone, quetiapine, risperidone, and/or ziprasidone). A few also included FGAs as a comparator (predominantly haloperidol). All studies demonstrated at least one neuroprotective mechanism of one or more SGAs, while some studies also showed that FGAs ranged from having no neuroprotective effects to actually exerting neurotoxic effects leading to neuronal death.
Conclusions: A review of the literature suggests that in addition to their antipsychotic efﬁcacy and low motoric side effects, SGAs exert measurable neuroprotective effects mediated via multiple molecular mechanisms and often in a dose-dependent manner. The neuroprotective effects of SGAs range from preventative to restorative and may play a salutary role in ameliorating the neurodegenerative effects of psychosis.},

Less well known is that the analysis of this phenomenon is vulnerable to a computational artifact first described by Eliot Slater, based on his reanalysis of data from manicdepressive patients first evaluated by Kraepelin at the Munich Psychiatric Institute. Slater realized that there is an increasingly disproportionate representation of faster-cycling patients in sub-samples involving higher cycle-counts in pooled samples of subjects. More accurate results require analyzing illness-course either within individuals, or in groups matched for episodecounts. This artifact is pervasive in the older and modern research literature, but still not widely recognized. Since Slater’s 1938 report in German is not well known, we provide an abbreviated English translation with commentary and additional reanalysis to highlight the phenomenon that might be termed ‘Slater’s Fallacy’.},

As population‐based data on the wider characteristics of excluded children are scarce, we aimed to describe predictors of school exclusion in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.
Method: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective U.K. populationbased birth cohort study, collected parent reports of permanent school exclusions by 8 years and parent and self‐reports of permanent and fixed‐term exclusions in the preceding 12 months at 16 years. Potential risk factors were examined for associations with exclusion using logistic regression, with a focus on child mental health and neurodevelopment.
Results: Analyses were based on all available data on 53/8,245 (0.6\%) pupils excluded from school by 8 years and 390/4,482 (8.7\%) at 16 years. Key factors associated with exclusion at both time points included male gender, lower socio‐economic status, maternal psychopathology, mental health and behavioural difficulties, psychiatric disorder, social communication difficulties, language difficulties, antisocial activities, bullying/being bulled, lower parental engagement with education, low school engagement, poor relationship with teacher, low educational attainment, and special educational needs (all p {\textless} .05).
Conclusion: Exclusion from school was associated with child, family and school‐related factors identifiable at, or prior to, primary school age. Child health professionals have an important role in the holistic, multidisciplinary assessment of children who are at risk of exclusion from school. Mental health and neurodevelopmental difficulties should be recognized and supported, to improve the health and educational outcomes among this vulnerable group.},

	abstract = {Background: The Auckland Regional Forensic Psychiatry Services (ARFPS) in New Zealand has introduced structured clinical judgment instruments developed in Ireland (DUNDRUM-3 and DUNDRUM-4) to assist staff decision-making regarding service users’ clinical pathways. In New Zealand, Māori (the indigenous people) constitute 43\% of the in-patient forensic mental health population. The aim of this study was to determine the face validity of the measures for Māori.
Methods: Participatory Action Research was aligned with a kaupapa Māori (Māori-orientated) research approach, to give full recognition to Māori cultural values. Two hui (gatherings) were held with Māori clinical and cultural experts at the service. The first hui (n = 12), explored the cultural appropriateness of the measures. The second (n = 10) involved a reflection on appropriate adaptions to the measures. Discussions were digitally recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed.
Results: Although the usefulness of the measures in enhancing the overall quality of clinical decision-making was confirmed, the DUNDRUM measures were considered to be limited in their ability to fully measure Māori service user progress and recovery. Suggestions were made to develop an additional ‘pillar’ focused on cultural identity and spirituality for DUNDRUM-3; to use both service user and family ratings for the adapted DUNDRUM-3 and DUNDRUM-4 measures; and to involve cultural expertise at the point of structured clinical judgement when using the measures.
Conclusions: This is the first study to consider the face validity of the DUNDRUM-3 and DUNDRUM-4 for indigenous peoples, who are internationally over-represented in forensic mental health services. Suggested changes would require a negotiated, collaborative process between Māori cultural expertise and the original authors of the measures.},

              Recently, increasing numbers of rare pathogenic genetic variants have been identified that are associated with variably elevated risks of a range of neurodevelopmental outcomes, notably including Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSD), and Intellectual Disability (ID). This review is organized along three main questions: First, how can we unify the exclusively descriptive basis of our current psychiatric diagnostic classification system with the recognition of an identifiable, highly penetrant genetic risk factor in an increasing proportion of patients with ASD or SSD? Second, what can be learned from studies of individuals with ASD or SSD who share a common genetic basis? And third, what accounts for the observed variable penetrance and pleiotropy of neuropsychiatric phenotypes in individuals with the same pathogenic variant? In this review, we focus on findings of clinical and preclinical studies of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). This particular variant is not only one of the most common among the increasing list of known rare pathogenic variants, but also one that benefits from a relatively long research history. Consequently, 22q11DS is an appealing model as it allows us to: (1) elucidate specific genotype–phenotype associations, (2) prospectively study behaviorally defined classifications, such as ASD or SSD, in the context of a known, well-characterized genetic basis, and (3) elucidate mechanisms underpinning variable penetrance and pleiotropy, phenomena with far-reaching ramifications for research and clinical practice. We discuss how findings from animal and in vitro
              s
              tudies relate to observations in human studies and can help elucidate factors, including genetic, environmental, and stochastic, that impact the expression of neuropsychiatric phenotypes in 22q11DS, and how this may inform mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental expression in the general population. We conclude with research priorities for the field, which may pave the way for novel therapeutics.},

Self-organizing systems engage in a continual dialogue with the environment and must adapt themselves to changing circumstances to keep internal entropy at a manageable level. We propose the entropy model of uncertainty (EMU), an integrative theoretical framework that applies the idea of entropy to the human information system to understand uncertaintyrelated anxiety. Four major tenets of EMU are proposed: (a) Uncertainty poses a critical adaptive challenge for any organism, so individuals are motivated to keep it at a manageable level; (b) uncertainty emerges as a function of the conflict between competing perceptual and behavioral affordances; (c) adopting clear goals and belief structures helps to constrain the experience of uncertainty by reducing the spread of competing affordances; and (d) uncertainty is experienced subjectively as anxiety and is associated with activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and with heightened noradrenaline release. By placing the discussion of uncertainty management, a fundamental biological necessity, within the framework of information theory and self-organizing systems, our model helps to situate key psychological processes within a broader physical, conceptual, and evolutionary context.},

Using variants of the model task Posner developed for exploring the control of visual attention we have demonstrated that endogenous shifts of attention are not generated by unexecuted oculomotor activation, that endogenous and exogenous shifts of attention are fundamentally different on a variety of dimensions and that an aftermath of exogenous (but not endogenous) orienting, inhibition of return, facilitates search by encouraging orienting to novel items.

Direct peripheral cues (brightening of one of four boxes in peripheral vision) and symbolic central cues (an arrow at the fixation point indicating a probable peripheral box) were compared. Peripheral and central cues are believed to activate different reflexive and voluntary modes of orienting (Jonides, 1981; Posner, 1980). Experiment 1 showed that the time courses of facilitation and inhibition from peripheral and central cues were characteristic and different. Experiment 2 showed that voluntary orienting in response to symbolic central cues is interrupted by reflexive orienting to random peripheral flashes. Experiment 3 showed that irrelevant peripheral flashes also compete with relevant peripheral cues. The amount of interference varied systematically with the interval between the onset of the relevant cue and of the distracting flash (cue-flash onset asynchrony) and with the cuing condition.

	abstract = {A new hypothesis about the role of focused attention is proposed. The feature-integration theory of attention suggests that attention must be directed serially to each stimulus in a display whenever conjunctions of more than one separable feature are needed to characterize or distinguish the possible objects presented. A number of predictions were tested in a variety of paradigms including visual search, texture segregation, identification and localization, and using both separable dimensions (shape and color) and local elements or parts of figures (lines, curves, etc. in letters) as the features to be integrated into complex wholes. The results were in general consistent with the hypothesis. They offer a new set of criteria for distinguishing separable from integral features and a new rationale for predicting which tasks will show attention limits and which will not.},

Frequently, debates about the ethical, social and legal implications of this area of research centre on questions about whether studies overtly or covertly perpetuate genetic determinism, genetic essentialism and/or genetic reductionism. Given the prominent role of the ‘-isms’ in scientific discourse and criticism, it is important for there to be consensus and clarity about the meaning of these terms. Here, the author integrates scholarship from psychology, genetics and philosophy of science to provide accessible definitions of genetic determinism, genetic reductionism and genetic essentialism. The author provides linguistic and visual examples of determinism, reductionism and essentialism in science and popular culture, discusses common misconceptions and concludes with recommendations for science communication.},

	abstract = {Background: Moral injury (MI) involves distress over having transgressed or violated core moral boundaries, accompanied by feelings of guilt, shame, self-condemnation, loss of trust, loss of meaning, and spiritual struggles. MI is often found in Veterans and Active Duty Military personnel with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). MI is widespread among those with PTSD symptoms, adversely affects mental health, and may increase risk of suicide; however, MI is often ignored and neglected by mental health professionals who focus their attention on PTSD only.
Methods: A review of the literature between 1980 and 2018 conducted in 2018 is presented here to identify scales used to assess MI. Databases used in this review were PsychInfo, PubMed (Medline), and Google Scholar. Search terms were “moral injury,” “measuring,” “screening,” “Veterans,” and “Active Duty Military.” Inclusion criteria were quantitative measurement of MI and health outcomes, Veteran or Active Duty Military status, and peer-review publication. Excluded were literature reviews, dissertations, book chapters, case reports, and qualitative studies.
Results: Of the 730 studies identified, most did not meet eligibility criteria, leaving 118 full text articles that were reviewed, of which 42 did not meet eligibility criteria. Of the remaining 76 studies, 34 were duplicates leaving 42 studies, most published in 2013 or later. Of 22 studies that assessed MI, five used scales assessing multiple dimensions, and 17 assessed only one or two aspects (e.g., guilt, shame, or forgiveness). The remaining 20 studies used one of the scales reported in the first 22. Of the five scales assessing multiple dimensions of MI, two assess both morally injurious events and symptoms and the remaining three assess symptoms only. All studies were cross-sectional, except three that tested interventions.
Conclusions: MI in the military setting is widespread and associated with PTSD symptom severity, anxiety, depression, and risk of suicide in current or former military personnel. Numerous measures exist to assess various dimensions of MI, including five multidimensional scales, although future research is needed to identify cutoff scores and clinically significant change scores. Three multidimensional measures assess MI symptoms alone (not events) and may be useful for determining if treatments directed at MI may both reduce symptoms and impact other mental health outcomes including PTSD.},

	abstract = {The term moral injury has been coined to describe the suﬀering that may develop following a violation of deeply held moral beliefs and values and subsequent diﬃculties in functioning. Yet despite an increase in research and intervention approaches for this topic, the relationship between moral injury and mental health diagnoses such as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains unclear and concern exists that, in some cases, moral injury might be used to unnecessarily pathologize moral processes. With the goal of further reﬁning the construct, we argue that moral injury is a condition distinct from PTSD and other disorders and, using a functional approach, propose enhanced deﬁnitions for the terms, morally injurious event, moral pain, moral injury, and moral healing. Consistent with these new deﬁnitions, we then argue for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) as a feasible and promising treatment for moral injury and present initial qualitative data supporting the intervention.},

The 45-item Moral Injury Symptom Scale (MISS-M) was administered to 591 veterans and ADM who had served in a combat theater and had PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms were measured with the PTSD Symptom Checklist-5, which assesses the four PTSD symptom clusters.

Findings for a 10-item version of the MISS-M (MISS-M-SF) closely followed those of the MISS-M.

This study examines the relationship between MI and suicide risk and the moderating effect of religiosity on this relationship in V/ADM with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional multi-site study involving 570 V/ADM from across the USA. Inclusion criteria were having served in a combat theater and the presence of PTSD symptoms. Multidimensional measures assessed MI, religiosity, PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and depression. In this secondary data analysis, a suicide risk index was created based on 10 known risk factors. Associations between MI and the suicide risk index were examined, controlling for demographic, religious, and military characteristics, and the moderating effects of religiosity were explored. Results: MI overall was correlated strongly with suicide risk (r = 0.54), as were MI subscales (ranging from r = 0.19 for loss of trust to 0.48 for self-condemnation). Controlling for other characteristics had little effect on this relationship (B = 0.016, SE = 0.001, p {\textless} 0.0001). Religiosity was unrelated to suicide risk and did not moderate the relationship between suicide risk and MI or any of its subscales. Conclusion: MI is strongly and independently associated with risk factors for suicide among V/ADM with PTSD symptoms, and religiosity does not mediate or moderate this relationship. Whether interventions that target MI reduce risk of suicide or suicidal ideation remains unknown and needs further study.},

	abstract = {Background. Although research has shown that exposure to potentially traumatic and morally injurious events is associated with psychological symptoms among veterans, knowledge regarding functioning impacts remains limited.
Methods. A population-based sample of post-9/11 veterans completed measures of intimate relationship, health, and work functioning at approximately 9, 15, 21, and 27 months after leaving service. Moral injury, posttraumatic stress, and depression were assessed at ∼9 months post-separation. We used Latent Growth Mixture Models to identify discrete classes characterized by unique trajectories of change in functioning over time and to examine predictors of class membership.
Results. Veterans were assigned to one of four functioning trajectories: high and stable, high and decreasing, moderate and increasing, and moderate and stable. Whereas posttraumatic stress, depression, and moral injury associated with perpetration and betrayal predicted worse outcomes at baseline across multiple functioning domains, moral injury associated with perpetration and depression most reliably predicted assignment to trajectories characterized by relatively poor or declining functioning.
Conclusions. Moral injury contributes to functional problems beyond what is explained by posttraumatic stress and depression, and moral injury due to perpetration and depression most reliably predicted assignment to trajectories characterized by functional impairment over time.},

Existential psychotherapy focuses on universal human concerns and the anxiety that occurs when a person confronts the conflicts inherent in life and toward death, which include the experience of difficult situations. A systematic review was performed including 56 papers that studied the relations between adverse experiences and existential concerns. The articles were assessed and described in relation to existential domains, type of adverse experience, posttraumatic responses, and existential psychological interventions. Existential concerns appeared in different degrees and categories in studied samples. Outcomes suggest that from an existential psychotherapy perspective, reactions to traumatic events can be both negative and positive for a person. In addition, the pass of time turned out to be an important factor, especially in finding meaning from traumatic experiences, the reduction of negative symptoms, and the achieving of posttraumatic growth. Existential-related interventions described in this review showed positive outcomes, suggesting that it is an effective trauma treatment approach.},

Despite being relatively unexplored with regards to psychological trauma, favourable empirical evidence is beginning to amass for existential therapy. A review of the contributions (and limitations) of existing approaches to trauma therapy is initially considered before the focus turns to the contribution that existential therapy might make, van Deurzen's existential dimensions (1997) and Jacobsen's existential conceptualisations of crisis are considered in some depth, along with the limitations and empirical challenges of existential therapy.

METHOD: A total of 131 Iraq and/or Afghanistan Veterans completed assessments of exposure to possible warzone traumas, meaning made of a salient stressor from their lives, and mental health symptomatology (e.g., posttraumatic stress, depression, suicidality).
RESULTS: Structural equation modeling findings revealed that MIEs were indirectly linked with mental health outcomes via the extent to which Veterans were able to make meaning of their identified stressors. However, we also found that the direct path from MIEs to mental health problems was statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide preliminary evidence that difficulties with meaning making could serve as a mediating pathway for how MIEs increase the risk for adjustment problems after warzone service, but that other factors associated with moral injury also have a bearing on psychological functioning among Veterans.},

We utilized thematic content analysis of life-stories of 19 combat veterans and 7 ex-POWs that have given testimony at the Israel Trauma Center for Victims of Terror and War (NATAL). Our findings suggest that the loneliness in the contexts at hand is primarily characterized by a sense of experiential isolation, rather than social, emotional, or existential. This is the sensation that due to the extraordinary nature of traumatic experiences the fulfillment of needs such as empathy and intersubjectivity may be unattainable. Integrating our findings with existing interdisciplinary literature regarding social sharing, trauma, and loneliness, we discuss implications for clinical interventions and further research.},

	abstract = {Existential anxiety (EA) is an expression of being occupied with ultimate concerns such as death, meaninglessness, and fundamental loneliness. Philosophers and psychologists have claimed its importance for the study of human thinking, emotion, decision making, and psychopathology. Until now research has mainly focused on death anxiety. Several death anxiety instruments have been developed and evaluated. This article is the first to review instruments measuring EA in a comprehensive way, that is, by covering several existential themes. Such instruments might be useful to gain insight in the interrelatedness of the aspects of EA, and application in clinical practice. Four models of EA were reviewed and compared resulting in a working definition. This definition was used to develop a search strategy that, after an initial screening, yielded 532 potentially relevant articles. A total of 78 instruments were identified, most of them measuring death anxiety. Five instruments were included that had a comprehensive perspective on EA. These were further evaluated using the consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments (COSMIN) criteria for publications about test development. The Existential Anxiety Questionnaire, turned out to be the most thoroughly examined, with promising results. The article concludes with recommendations about development and use of EA instruments.},

Using qualitative data from interviews with 28 combat veterans, we examine IOK’s impact, how it differs from other trauma-focused treatments, and how it can be improved to better meet veterans’ needs. We found that many veterans processed their killing experiences for the first time in IOK, even though all had previously completed evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder. Several described killing in war as the most distressing and transformative trauma of their lives, and all affirmed the value of an intervention focused directly and explicitly on moral injury and killing. IOK helped veterans to acknowledge their grief, shame, and distress; gently but critically examine their thoughts and beliefs about killing in war; and make strides toward acceptance, reconciliation, and forgiveness.},

Participants were 122 U.S. Marines and Sailors. The primary endpoint was PTSD symptom severity change from pre- to posttreatment, using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV. Secondary endpoints were depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9) and functioning (Veterans Rand Health Survey-12; VR-12). For cases with complete data, the mean difference in CAPS-IV change scores was 0.33 and the confidence interval (CI) did not include the predefined NI margin (95\% CI =-10.10, 9.44). The mean difference in PHQ-9 change scores was -1.01 and the CI did not include the predefined margin (95\% CI = -3.31, 1.28), as was the case for the VR-12 Physical Component and VR-12 Mental Component subscale scores (0.27; 95\% CI = -4.50, 3.95, and -2.10; 95\% CI = -7.03, 2.83, respectively). A series of intent-to-treat sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. The differential effect size for CAPS-IV was d = 0.01 (nonsignificant). As predicted, Adaptive Disclosure was found to be no less effective than a first-line psychotherapy.},

Transgressions-Other and Transgressions-Self were significantly higher among personnel with a history of suicide attempt relative to history of suicidal ideation and no suicidality (Hedge’s g’s Ͼ .64).

However, working definitions of moral injury have not yet fully clarified the mechanisms whereby violations of conscience result in these outcomes or their co-occurrence with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this paper, advances from the field of moral psychology are used to integrate cognitive, affective, and social dimensions of the emerging moral injury construct, while also pointing to new possibilities for clinical intervention. After reviewing the salience of moral injury for military and veteran populations, the presence of negative moral emotions (e.g., guilt, anger, disgust) are examined within the context of trauma and military-related PTSD. Next, social functionalist accounts of moral emotions are used to explain the development of moral injury and are linked to potential etiologies of PTSD that emphasize both fear and nonfear emotions. Finally, the clinical importance of positive moral emotions for existing and emerging trauma-focused interventions is discussed. Future directions for research and clinical interventions are identified highlighting the importance of utilizing community support.},

Although there is a proliferation of interest in moral injury (the outcome associated with exposure to PMIEs), there has been no operational definition of the putative syndrome and no standard assessment scheme or measure, which has hampered research and care in this area. We describe an international effort to define the syndrome of moral injury and develop and validate the Moral Injury Outcome Scale (MIOS) in three stages. To ensure content validity, in Stage I, we conducted interviews with service members, Veterans, and clinicians/Chaplains in each country, inquiring about the lasting impact of PMIEs. Qualitative analysis yielded six operational definitions of domains of impact of PMIEs and components within domains that establish the parameters of the moral injury syndrome. From the domain definitions, we derived an initial pool of scale items. Stage II entailed scale refinement using factor analytic methods, cross-national invariance testing, and internal consistency reliability analyses of an initial 34-item MIOS. A 14-item MIOS was invariant and reliable across countries and had two factors: Shame-Related (SR) and Trust-Violation-Related (TVR) Outcomes. In Stage III, MIOS total and subscale scores had strong convergent validity, and PMIE-endorsers had substantially higher MIOS scores vs. non-endorsers. We discuss and contextualize the results and describe research that is needed to substantiate these inaugural findings to further explore the validity of the MIOS and moral injury, in particular to examine discriminant and incremental validity.},

We also examined the prevalence of perpetration-based PMIEs, during which service members behaved in ways that violated their own moral values, and betrayal-based PMIEs, during which personal moral expectations were violated by trusted others. Method: Using a sample of 867 active duty Marines from a single infantry battalion that engaged in heavy ground combat while deployed to Afghanistan, a structural equation model was built to examine the relationships between perpetration- and betrayal-based PMIEs, combat experiences, and peritraumatic dissociation reported at 1 month postdeployment, and guilt/shame, anger, and PTSD symptoms reported at 8 months postdeployment. Results: The relationship between betrayal-based PMIEs and PTSD was mediated by anger (␤ ϭ .14). There was marginal evidence of mediation of the relationship between perpetration-based PMIEs and PTSD by shame and guilt (␤ ϭ .09), and of the relationship between danger-based combat events and PTSD by peritraumatic dissociation (␤ ϭ .08). No significant direct relationships were found between any of these 3 types of events and subsequent PTSD. Perceived perpetration and betrayal accounted for PTSD symptoms above and beyond combat exposure. Over a third of the sample reported experiencing perpetration- or betrayal-based PMIEs. Conclusions: The associations of perpetration and betrayal with PTSD, controlling for dangerbased combat events, highlight the limitations of conceptualizations and treatments of PTSD based on fear or helplessness as sole etiologic factors.},

We found that, for many veterans, killing provokes a moral conflict with a lasting impact on their sense of self, spirituality, and relationships with others.

We administered an 11-item, self-report Moral Injury Events Scale to active duty Marines 1 week and 3 months following war-zone deployment. Two items were eliminated because of low item-total correlations. The remaining 9 items were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis, which revealed two latent factors that we labeled perceived transgressions and perceived betrayals; these were conﬁrmed via conﬁrmatory factor analysis on an independent sample. The overall Moral Injury Events Scale and its two subscales had favorable internal validity, and comparisons between the 1-week and 3-month data suggested good temporal stability.

This study tests the eﬃcacy of a spiritually integrated intervention “Building Spiritual Strength” (BSS) that can be delivered by trained chaplains. The intervention addresses spiritual concerns expressed by trauma survivors, including concerns in relationship with a Higher Power, diﬃculty with forgiveness, and theodicy. In a randomized controlled trial with blinded assessment, veterans were randomized to engage in a BSS condition (n = 71) or Present Centered Group Therapy (PCGT; control) condition (n = 67) with assessments at baseline, posttreatment, and a two-month follow up. Both groups showed similar, statistically signiﬁcant reductions in symptoms of PTSD as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). BSS was shown to be more eﬀective than PCGT in treating distress in relationship with a Higher Power. This was the second clinical trial of BSS with promising results and highlights the need for further study in psychospiritual interventions. More research is warranted on BSS being oﬀered by non-specialized chaplains and on the application of BSS in suicide prevention.},

	abstract = {Background
Questions persist about how often potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) are associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.
Methods
This study examined the overlap of morally injurious events with probable PTSD and depression in a nationally representative sample of U.S. combat veterans (n = 1,321, mean age 59.1, 93.7\% male).
Results
Most veterans with probable PTSD (72.2\%), probable depression (72.4\%), and probable PTSD and/or depression (68.4\%), endorsed experiencing PMIEs; 31.1–35.3\% of these participants endorsed perpetration, 45.1–50.4\% endorsed witnessing others, and 52.6–55.7\% endorsed betrayal. The prevalence of PMIEs among veterans without current probable PTSD and/or depression was 33.7\%, 32.3\%, and 31.5\%, respectively; 7.9–9.1\% of these participants endorsed perpetration-based PMIEs, 19.2–20.3\% witnessing, and 19.8–21.8\% endorsed betrayal. PMIEs were more prevalent among veterans with probable PTSD or depression relative to those without (ORs ranging 2.14–3.32; p's {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions
This is the first nationally representative study to examine the prevalence of PMIEs among veterans with and without probable PTSD or depression. Results highlight the importance of understanding distress and functional impairment in these veterans to evaluate whether they may benefit from intervention. PMIEs were strikingly more prevalent among veterans with probable PTSD and depression, suggesting that veterans without PMIEs are the minority among combat veterans with these disorders.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study synthesized evidence regarding the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States (US).
Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) identified recently published (2015–2019) observational studies of PTSD prevalence in the US via the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Eligible studies’ most recent data were collected no earlier than 2013. Data elements extracted included study design, sample size, location, data source/year(s), study population(s), traumatic event type, prevalance estimates with corresponding look-back periods, and clinical metrics.
Results: Data from 38 identified articles were categorized by population, diagnostic criteria, and lookback period. Among civilians, point prevalence ranged from 8.0\% to 56.7\%, 1-year prevalence from 2.3\% to 9.1\%, and lifetime prevalence from 3.4\% to 26.9\%. In military populations, point prevalence ranged from 1.2\% to 87.5\%, 1-year prevalence from 6.7\% to 50.2\%, and lifetime prevalence from 7.7\% to 17.0\%. Within these ranges, several estimates were derived from relatively high quality data; these articles are highlighted in the review. Prevalence was elevated in subpopulations including emergency responders, refugees, American Indian/Alaska Natives, individuals with heavy substance use, individuals with a past suicide attempt, trans-masculine individuals, and women with prior military sexual trauma. Female sex, lower income, younger age, and behavioral health conditions were identified as risk factors for PTSD.
Conclusions: PTSD prevalence estimates varied widely, partly due to different study designs, populations, and methodologies, and recent nationally representative estimates were lacking. Efforts to increase PTSD screening and improve disease awareness may allow for a better detection and management of PTSD.},

	abstract = {Background: Given the wide range of depressive disorders, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in various military studies around the world, determining the exact prevalence of these disorders in line with health planning as well as care and treatment service designing for military forces can be useful. The aim of the present metaanalysis was to determine the pooled prevalence of depressive disorders, suicide thoughts, and attempts in the military.
Methods: The present systematic review and meta-analysis study was performed based on PRISMA criteria in 5 steps of the search strategy, screening and selection of articles, data extraction, evaluation of article quality and meta-analysis. International databases (PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Web of science, Embase (Elsevier), PsycInfo (Ovid), Cochrane CENTRAL (Ovid)) were searched using related keywords extracted from Mesh and Emtree. After screening and final selection of articles, data were extracted and qualitative evaluation was performed using the NOS checklist.
Results: The results of meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression in active military forces and veterans was 23\% (\%95 CI: 20–26\%) and 20\% (\%95 CI: 18–22\%), respectively. In addition, the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in the military was 11\% (\%95 CI: 10–13\%) and 11\% (\%95 CI: 9–13\%), respectively. The prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts in drug-using military was 18\% (\%95 CI: 7–33\%) and 30\% (\%95 CI: 23–36\%), respectively. The prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in military consuming alcohol were 9\% (\%95 CI: 4–13\%) and 8\% (\%95 CI: 7–10\%), respectively. In militaries with AIDS / HIV, the prevalence of suicide attempts was 5\% (\%95 CI: 4–8\%).
Conclusion: Therefore, it is necessary to develop and design training and intervention programs in order to increase the awareness of the military, especially veterans, to prevent the occurrence of suicide and depression.},

This qualitative study formed 'Phase 1' of a larger study into PMIEs experienced by Australian veterans and the potential pastoral/spiritual care role of chaplains. Two seminars were conducted that involved 10 veterans being interviewed and audio recorded about their deployment experiences to evaluate whether there was any evidence among Australian veterans of a PMIE. Narrative data analysis indicated that all participants had been exposed to, or were involved in, a PMIE of one kind or another. Seven key themes were identified from the analyzed qualitative data: (i) immoral acts, (ii) death and injury, (iii) betrayal, (iv) ethical dilemmas, (v) disproportionate violence, (vi) retribution and (vii) religious/spiritual issues. Given this preliminary PMIE evidence identified, there is a need for further research, as well as the development of a suitable moral injury assessment scale appropriate for Australian veterans. Furthermore, given the ethical, moral, and spiritual issues involved, the implementation of a rehabilitation program suitable for Australian veterans which can be provided by chaplains is also suggested-namely 'Pastoral Narrative Disclosure.' It is argued that moral injury needs to be recognized, not just as an issue affecting individual personnel and their families, but is also a community health, organizational and government responsibility.},

Method: 930 National Guard personnel from the states of Utah and Idaho completed an anonymous online survey. Exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) was used to test a measurement model of PTSD and moral injury. A structural model was next constructed to test the interactive effects of PTSD and moral injury on history of suicide ideation and attempts. Results: Results of the ESEM confirmed that PTSD and moral injury were distinct constructs characterized by unique symptoms, although depressed mood loaded onto both PTSD and moral injury. The interaction of PTSD and moral injury was associated with significantly increased risk for suicide ideation and attempts. A sensitivity analysis indicated the interaction remained a statistically significant predictor of suicide attempt even among the subgroup of participants with a history of suicide ideation. Conclusion: PTSD and moral injury represent separate constructs with unique signs and symptoms. The combination of PTSD and moral injury confers increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and differentiates between military personnel who have attempted suicide and those who have only thought about suicide.

	abstract = {Numerous reports have linked moral injury (i.e., experience or perpetration of a morally unjust event) with suicidal ideation and outcomes; however, little is known regarding mechanisms that may influence this association. According to empirically supported theories of suicide, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness may lead to increased suicidal ideation. Furthermore, nascent research has linked thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness with moral injury. However, no work to date has examined whether thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness explain the association between moral injury and suicidal ideation. The current sample consisted of 151 female National Guard members recruited as part of a larger research study. Results indicated a significant association between moral injury and suicidal ideation that was indirect through thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. These findings highlight important and malleable mechanisms that may lead to increased suicide risk among women exposed to morally injurious events. Furthermore, this work extends our current understanding of moral injury and suicide by examining these constructs among a sample of female service members.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Evidence is growing regarding the impact of potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) on mental health; yet how moral injury may affect an individual's occupational and familial functioning remains poorly understood.
METHOD: Thirty male veterans who reported exposure to either traumatic or morally injurious events and 15 clinicians were recruited for semi-structured qualitative interviews.
RESULTS: While many veterans experienced psychological distress postevent, those who experienced PMIEs especially reported social withdrawal and engagement in aggressive, risk-taking behaviours. This was highly distressing for family members and created a tense, volatile home and workplace environment that was difficult for others to navigate. Following PMIEs, employment could be used as a cognitive avoidance strategy or as a means to atone for transgressive acts. In cases of moral injury, clinicians considered that targeted support for spouses and accessible guidance to help children to better understand how their military parent may be feeling would be beneficial.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some of the first evidence of the pervasive negative impact of PMIEs on veterans' familial and occupational functioning. These findings highlight the need to comprehensively screen for the impact of moral injury on daily functioning in future studies that goes beyond just an assessment of psychological symptoms.},

Transgressions-Others was most strongly associated with posttraumatic stress; Transgressions-Self was most strongly associated with hopelessness, pessimism, and anger; and Betrayal was most strongly associated with posttraumatic stress and anger.

	abstract = {Moral injury is an emerging construct related to negative consequences associated with war-zone stressors that transgress military veterans' deeply held values/beliefs. Given the newness of the construct, there is a need for instrumentation that might assess morally injurious experiences (MIEs) in this population. Drawing on a community sample of 131 Iraq and/or Afghanistan Veterans and clinical sample of 82 returning Veterans, we conducted an initial psychometric evaluation of the newly developed Moral Injury Questionnaire—Military version (MIQ-M)—a 20-item self-report measure for assessing MIEs. Possibly due to low rates of reporting, an item assessing sexual trauma did not yield favourable psychometric properties and was excluded from analyses. Veterans in the clinical sample endorsed significantly higher scores across MIQ-M items. Factor analytic results for the final 19 items supported a unidimensional structure, and convergent validity analyses revealed that higher scores (indicative of more MIEs) were correlated with greater general combat exposure, impairments in work/social functioning, posttraumatic stress and depression in the community sample. In addition, when controlling for demographics, deployment-related factors and exposure to life threat stressors associated with combat, tests of incremental validity indicated that MIQ-M scores were also uniquely linked with suicide risk and other mental health outcomes. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the validity of the MIQ-M and support the applicability of this measure for further research and clinical work with Veterans. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message Military service can confront service members with experiences that undermine their core sense of humanity and violate global values and beliefs. These types of experiences increase the risk for posttraumatic maladjustment in this population, even when accounting for rates of exposure to life threat traumas. Moral injury is an emerging construct to more fully capture the many possible psychological, ethical, and spiritual/existential challenges among persons who served in modern wars and other trauma-exposed professional groups. There is currently a need for psychometrically sound instrumentation for assessing morally injurious experiences (MIEs). The Moral Injury Questionnaire – Military Version (MIQ-M) was developed to provide a tool for assessing possible MIEs among military populations. This study provides preliminary evidence of the validity – including factorial, concurrent, and incremental – and clinical utility of the MIQ-M for further applications in clinical and research contexts.},

	abstract = {Moral injury (MI) results from perpetration of or exposure to distressing events, known as morally injurious events (MIEs), that challenge moral beliefs and values. Due to the type of involvement in recent military conflicts, many veterans report MIEs that may cause dissonance and, in turn, MI. Although 2 existing measures assess MIEs, neither currently assesses the defining characteristics of MI (i.e., guilt, shame, difficulty forgiving self and others, and withdrawal). The present study reports the initial psychometric test of a modified version (Robbins, Kelley, Hamrick, Bravo, \& White, 2017) of the Moral Injury Questionnaire—Military version (MIQ-M; Currier, Holland, Drescher, \& Foy, 2015) in a sample of 328 military personnel (e.g., veterans, National Guard/reservists, and active-duty members). The MIQ-M was modified to assess both MIEs and the defining characteristics of MI. Exploratory factor analyses suggested a 3-factor model of MIEs consisting of Atrocities of War, Psychological Consequences of War, and Leadership Failure or Betrayal. The modified MIQ-M factors were correlated with defining characteristics of MI. In addition, each MIE factor and associated defining characteristics of MI were positively correlated with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety, as well as substance use. The modified MIQ-M is a reliable measure of MI that comprises 3 subscales that are associated with, but distinct from, mental health outcomes. Although findings are promising, further research evaluating the applicability of the modified MIQ-M in clinical settings is required to establish construct validity of the defining characteristics and secondary manifestations of MI.},

The sample was randomly split in two. In the first half (n = 214), exploratory factor analysis identified the highest loading item on each of the 10 MISS scales (guilt, shame, moral concerns, loss of meaning, difficulty forgiving, loss of trust, self-condemnation, religious struggle, and loss of religious faith) to form the 10-item MISS-M-SF; confirmatory factor analysis was then performed to replicate results in the second half of the sample (n = 213). Internal reliability, test–retest reliability, and convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity were examined in the overall sample. The study was approved by the institutional review boards and the Research \&amp; Development (R\&amp;D) Committees at Veterans Administration medical centers in Durham, Los Angeles, Augusta, Houston, and San Antonio, and the Liberty University and Duke University Medical Center institutional review boards.The 10-item MISS-M-SF had a median of 50 and a range of 12–91 (possible range 10–100). Over 70\% scored a 9 or 10 (highest possible) on at least one item. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.73 (95\% CI 0.69–0.76), and test–retest reliability was 0.87 (95\% CI 0.79–0.92). Convergent validity with the 45-item MISS-M was r = 0.92. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by relatively weak correlations with social, religious, and physical health constructs (r = 0.21–0.35), and concurrent validity was indicated by strong correlations with PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms (r = 0.54–0.58).The MISS-M-SF is a reliable and valid measure of MI symptoms that can be used to screen for MI and monitor response to treatment in veterans and active duty military with PTSD.},

	abstract = {Prolonged exposure therapy (PE) was developed as a specific treatment to ameliorate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related problems. PE is a manualized treatment that includes four primary components: repeated revisiting of the trauma memories (imaginal exposure), repeated exposure to avoided situations (in vivo exposure), education about common reactions to trauma, and breathing retraining. Treatment with PE involves psychoeducation about the rationale for treatment and common reactions to trauma. Breathing retraining involves teaching the patient a technique to reduce overall physiological arousal by focusing on slow, rhythmic, and relaxed breathing. This skill is taught early in PE treatment because it is a tool that patients can use immediately to help alleviate anxiety symptoms and create a sense of mastery over daily anxiety and distress. Comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature and meta-analyses have consistently documented the efficacy of PE for the treatment of PTSD in civilian populations. This chapter briefly describes the research on PE with military and veteran populations and PE's strengths related to its use with military personnel. It also discusses the limitations of PE with active-duty military personnel. Additional details about the enhancements to the standard PE treatment protocol are included in the case vignette.

The search strategy combined search terms from 3 themes: (1) mental illness (including depression and anxiety), (2) COVID-19, and (3) children and adolescents (age ≤18 years). For PsycArXiv, the key terms COVID-19, mental health, and child/adolescent were used.Studies were included if they were published in English, had quantitative data, and reported prevalence of clinically elevated depression or anxiety in youth (age ≤18 years).A total of 3094 nonduplicate titles/abstracts were retrieved, and 136 full-text articles were reviewed. Data were analyzed from March 8 to 22, 2021.Prevalence rates of clinically elevated depression and anxiety symptoms in youth.Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted. Twenty-nine studies including 80 879 participants met full inclusion criteria. Pooled prevalence estimates of clinically elevated depression and anxiety symptoms were 25.2\% (95\% CI, 21.2\%-29.7\%) and 20.5\% (95\% CI, 17.2\%-24.4\%), respectively. Moderator analyses revealed that the prevalence of clinically elevated depression and anxiety symptoms were higher in studies collected later in the pandemic and in girls. Depression symptoms were higher in older children.Pooled estimates obtained in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that 1 in 4 youth globally are experiencing clinically elevated depression symptoms, while 1 in 5 youth are experiencing clinically elevated anxiety symptoms. These pooled estimates, which increased over time, are double of prepandemic estimates. An influx of mental health care utilization is expected, and allocation of resources to address child and adolescent mental health concerns are essential.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a critical need for real-time tracking of behavioral indicators of mental disorders. Mobile sensing platforms that objectively and noninvasively collect, store, and analyze behavioral indicators have not yet been clinically validated or scalable.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to report on models of clinical symptoms for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression derived from a scalable mobile sensing platform.
METHODS: A total of 73 participants (67\% [49/73] male, 48\% [35/73] non-Hispanic white, 33\% [24/73] veteran status) who reported at least one symptom of PTSD or depression completed a 12-week field trial. Behavioral indicators were collected through the noninvasive mobile sensing platform on participants' mobile phones. Clinical symptoms were measured through validated clinical interviews with a licensed clinical social worker. A combination hypothesis and data-driven approach was used to derive key features for modeling symptoms, including the sum of outgoing calls, count of unique numbers texted, absolute distance traveled, dynamic variation of the voice, speaking rate, and voice quality. Participants also reported ease of use and data sharing concerns.
RESULTS: Behavioral indicators predicted clinically assessed symptoms of depression and PTSD (cross-validated area under the curve [AUC] for depressed mood=.74, fatigue=.56, interest in activities=.75, and social connectedness=.83). Participants reported comfort sharing individual data with physicians (Mean 3.08, SD 1.22), mental health providers (Mean 3.25, SD 1.39), and medical researchers (Mean 3.03, SD 1.36).
CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral indicators passively collected through a mobile sensing platform predicted symptoms of depression and PTSD. The use of mobile sensing platforms can provide clinically validated behavioral indicators in real time; however, further validation of these models and this platform in large clinical samples is needed.},

	abstract = {Background: Internalizing disorders are the most common psychiatric problems observed among youth in Canada. Sadly, youth with internalizing disorders often avoid seeking clinical help and rarely receive adequate treatment. Current methods of assessing internalizing disorders usually rely on subjective symptom ratings, but internalizing symptoms are frequently underreported, which creates a barrier to the accurate assessment of these symptoms in youth. Therefore, novel assessment tools that use objective data need to be developed to meet the highest standards of reliability, feasibility, scalability, and affordability. Mobile sensing technologies, which unobtrusively record aspects of youth behaviors in their daily lives with the potential to make inferences about their mental health states, offer a possible method of addressing this assessment barrier.
Objective: This study aims to explore whether passively collected smartphone sensor data can be used to predict internalizing symptoms among youth in Canada.
Methods: In this study, the youth participants (N=122) completed self-report assessments of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Next, the participants installed an app, which passively collected data about their mobility, screen time, sleep, and social interactions over 2 weeks. Then, we tested whether these passive sensor data could be used to predict internalizing symptoms among these youth participants.
Results: More severe depressive symptoms correlated with more time spent stationary (r=0.293; P=.003), less mobility (r=0.271; P=.006), higher light intensity during the night (r=0.227; P=.02), and fewer outgoing calls (r=−0.244; P=.03). In contrast, more severe anxiety symptoms correlated with less time spent stationary (r=−0.249; P=.01) and greater mobility (r=0.234; P=.02). In addition, youths with higher anxiety scores spent more time on the screen (r=0.203; P=.049). Finally, adding passively collected smartphone sensor data to the prediction models of internalizing symptoms significantly improved their fit.
Conclusions: Passively collected smartphone sensor data provide a useful way to monitor internalizing symptoms among youth. Although the results replicated findings from adult populations, to ensure clinical utility, they still need to be replicated in larger samples of youth. The work also highlights intervention opportunities via mobile technology to reduce the burden of internalizing symptoms early on.},

Previous studies of stress detection using smartphone data focused on a single feature and did not consider all features simultaneously. We propose a method to extract a co-occurring combination of a user’s real-world and online behavioral features by converting raw sensor data into categorical features. We conducted an experiment in which the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to assess the anxiety-related stress levels of 20 healthy participants. The participants installed a log-collecting application on their smartphones and answered the STAI questions once a day for one month. The proposed method showed an F-score of 74.2\%, which is 4.0\% higher than the F-score of previous studies (70.2\%) that used single non-combined features. The results demonstrate that anxiety-related stress levels can be predicted using combined features extracted from smartphone log data.},

This study compared performance of patient-reported measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety symptoms using traditional paper-and-pencil forms versus real-time, ambulatory measurement of symptoms via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Sixty-seven emotionally distressed older adults completed paper-and-pencil measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety along with two weeks of identical items reported during ambulatory monitoring via EMA before and after participation in a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or a health education intervention. We calculated effect sizes for these measures across both measurement approaches and estimated the Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNT) in both measurement conditions. Study outcomes greatly differed depending on which measurement method was used. When EMA was used to measure clinical symptoms, older adults who participated in the MBSR intervention had significantly higher mindfulness and significantly lower depression and anxiety than participants in the health education intervention at post-treatment. However, these significant changes in symptoms were not found when outcomes were measured with paper-and-pencil measures. The NNT for mindfulness and depression measures administered through EMA were approximately 25-50\% lower than NNTs derived from paper-and-pencil administration. Sensitivity to change in anxiety was similar across administration modes. In conclusion, EMA measures of depression and mindfulness substantially outperformed paper-and-pencil measures with the same items. The additional resources associated with EMA in clinical trials would seem to be offset by its greater sensitivity to detect change in key outcome variables.,},

The present study used three measures that decomposed mood states into their constituent elements to examine whether certain components selectively contributed to this negative bias or all components contributed to this bias equally. Fifty-three participants responded to the questionnaires via the Internet every evening for two weeks. On the final day, participants recalled and retrospectively evaluated their mood state over the previous two weeks as a whole. The results revealed that memory bias occurred selectively for negative mood states. Anxiety, depression, and helplessness were exaggerated in the global compared with the daily ratings. None of the positive mood components showed any bias in the retrospective global ratings. A regression analysis indicated that the difference in daily and global ratings for negative mood was partly explained by peak and final scores. Higher peak scores led to greater overestimation whereas final scores had smaller effects; the higher the final score was, the less participants overestimated their negative mood in the global ratings.},

	abstract = {Background: Research in psychology demonstrates a strong link between state affect (moment-to-moment experiences of positive or negative emotionality) and trait affect (eg, relatively enduring depression and social anxiety symptoms), and a tendency to withdraw (eg, spending time at home). However, existing work is based almost exclusively on static, self-reported descriptions of emotions and behavior that limit generalizability. Despite adoption of increasingly sophisticated research designs and technology (eg, mobile sensing using a global positioning system [GPS]), little research has integrated these seemingly disparate forms of data to improve understanding of how emotional experiences in everyday life are associated with time spent at home, and whether this is influenced by depression or social anxiety symptoms. Objective: We hypothesized that more time spent at home would be associated with more negative and less positive affect. Methods: We recruited 72 undergraduate participants from a southeast university in the United States. We assessed depression and social anxiety symptoms using self-report instruments at baseline. An app (Sensus) installed on participants’ personal mobile phones repeatedly collected in situ self-reported state affect and GPS location data for up to 2 weeks. Time spent at home was a proxy for social isolation. Results: We tested separate models examining the relations between state affect and time spent at home, with levels of depression and social anxiety as moderators. Models differed only in the temporal links examined. One model focused on associations between changes in affect and time spent at home within short, 4-hour time windows. The other 3 models focused on associations between mean-level affect within a day and time spent at home (1) the same day, (2) the following day, and (3) the previous day. Overall, we obtained many of the expected main effects (although there were some null effects), in which higher social anxiety was associated with more time or greater likelihood of spending time at home, and more negative or less positive affect was linked to longer homestay. Interactions indicated that, among individuals higher in social anxiety, higher negative affect and lower positive affect within a day was associated with greater likelihood of spending time at home the following day. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of modeling the relationship between affect and homestay using fine-grained GPS data. Although these findings must be replicated in a larger study and with clinical samples, they suggest that integrating repeated state affect assessments in situ with continuous GPS data can increase understanding of how actual homestay is related to affect in everyday life and to symptoms of anxiety and depression.},

	abstract = {Collecting and analyzing data from sensors embedded in the context of daily life has been widely employed for the monitoring of mental health. Variations in parameters such as movement, sleep duration, heart rate, electrocardiogram, skin temperature, etc., are often associated with psychiatric disorders. Namely, accelerometer data, microphone, and call logs can be utilized to identify voice features and social activities indicative of depressive symptoms, and physiological factors such as heart rate and skin conductance can be used to detect stress and anxiety disorders. Therefore, a wide range of devices comprising a variety of sensors have been developed to capture these physiological and behavioral data and translate them into phenotypes and states related to mental health. Such systems aim to identify behaviors that are the consequence of an underlying physiological alteration, and hence, the raw sensor data are captured and converted into features that are used to define behavioral markers, often through machine learning. However, due to the complexity of passive data, these relationships are not simple and need to be well-established. Furthermore, parameters such as intrapersonal and interpersonal differences need to be considered when interpreting the data. Altogether, combining practical mobile and wearable systems with the right data analysis algorithms can provide a useful tool for the monitoring and management of mental disorders. The current review aims to comprehensively present and critically discuss all available smartphone-based, wearable, and environmental sensors for detecting such parameters in relation to the treatment and/or management of the most common mental health conditions.},

There is a lack of formal guidelines for the design of new digital phenotyping studies so that they are powered to detect both population-level longitudinal associations as well as individual-level change points in multivariate time series. In particular, determining the appropriate balance of sample size relative to the targeted duration of follow-up is a challenge.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data from 2 prior smartphone-based digital phenotyping studies to provide reasonable ranges of effect size and parameters. We considered likelihood ratio tests for generalized linear mixed models as well as for change point detection of individual-level multivariate time series.
RESULTS: We propose a joint procedure for sequentially calculating first an appropriate length of follow-up and then a necessary minimum sample size required to provide adequate power. In addition, we developed an accompanying accessible sample size and power calculator.
DISCUSSION: The 2-parameter problem of identifying both an appropriate sample size and duration of follow-up for a longitudinal study requires the simultaneous consideration of 2 analysis methods during study design.
CONCLUSION: The temporally dense longitudinal data collected by digital phenotyping studies may warrant a variety of applicable analysis choices. Our use of generalized linear mixed models as well as change point detection to guide sample size and study duration calculations provide a tool to effectively power new digital phenotyping studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective was to estimate the age of onset (AOO) for all anxiety disorders and for specific subtypes. Gender differences in the AOO of anxiety disorders were examined, as were the influence of study characteristics on reported AOOs.
METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched up to October 2014, with keywords representing anxiety disorder subtypes, AOO, and study design. The inclusion criteria were studies using a general population sample that provided data on the AOO for all anxiety disorders, or specific anxiety disorders, according to DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, or ICD-10 criteria.
RESULTS: There were 1028 titles examined, which yielded 24 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Eight studies reported the AOO and gender. Meta-analysis found a mean AOO of all anxiety disorders of 21.3 years (95\% CI 17.46 to 25.07). Separation anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and social phobia had their mean onset before the age of 15 years, whereas the AOO of agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder began, on average, between 21.1 and 34.9 years. Meta-analysis revealed no difference in the AOO between genders. A prospective study design and higher developmental level of the study country were associated with an earlier AOO.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this meta-analysis indicate that anxiety disorder subtypes differ in the mean AOO, with onsets ranging from early adolescence to young adulthood. These findings suggest that prevention strategies of anxiety disorders should be directed towards factors associated with the development of anxiety disorder subtypes in the age groups with the greatest vulnerability for developing those disorders.},

METHOD: Data were obtained from youth (N = 438; 7-17 years old) who completed treatment in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal treatment Study, a multisite, randomized clinical trial that examined the relative efficacy of medication (sertraline), cognitive-behavioral therapy (Coping Cat), their combination, and pill placebo for the treatment of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. The parent- and youth-report SCARED were administered at pre- and posttreatment. Quality receiver operating characteristic methods evaluated the performance of various SCARED percent reduction and absolute cutoff scores in predicting treatment response and remission, as defined by posttreatment ratings on the Clinical Global Impression scales and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule.
RESULTS: Reductions of 55\% on the SCARED-Parent and 50\% on the SCARED-Youth optimally predicted treatment response. Posttreatment absolute raw scores of 10 (SCARED-Parent) and 12 (SCARED-Youth) optimally predicted remission in the total sample, although separate SCARED-Parent cutoffs for children (12-13) and adolescents (9) showed greatest quality of efficiency. Each cutoff significantly predicted response and remission at 6-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Results serve as guidelines for operationalizing treatment response and remission on the SCARED, which could help clinicians systematically monitor treatment outcomes of youth with anxiety disorders in a cost- and time-efficient manner.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism developed an alcohol screening instrument for youth based on epidemiologic data. This study examines the concurrent validity of this instrument, expanded to include tobacco and drugs, among pediatric patients, as well as the acceptability of its self-administration on an iPad.

METHODS:
Five hundred and twenty-five patients (54.5\% female; 92.8\% African American) aged 12 to 17 completed the Brief Screener for Tobacco, Alcohol, and other Drugs (BSTAD) via interviewer-administration or self-administration using an iPad. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition substance use disorders (SUDs) were identified using a modified Composite International Diagnostic Interview-2 Substance Abuse Module. Receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivities, and specificities were obtained to determine optimal cut points on the BSTAD in relation to SUDs.

RESULTS:
One hundred fifty-nine (30.3\%) adolescents reported past-year use of ≥1 substances on the BSTAD: 113 (21.5\%) used alcohol, 84 (16.0\%) used marijuana, and 50 (9.5\%) used tobacco. Optimal cut points for past-year frequency of use items on the BSTAD to identify SUDs were ≥6 days of tobacco use (sensitivity = 0.95; specificity = 0.97); ≥2 days of alcohol use (sensitivity = 0.96; specificity = 0.85); and ≥2 days of marijuana use (sensitivity = 0.80; specificity = 0.93). iPad self-administration was preferred over interviewer administration (z = 5.8; P {\textless} .001).

CONCLUSIONS:
The BSTAD is a promising screening tool for identifying problematic tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use in pediatric settings. Even low frequency of substance use among adolescents may indicate need for intervention.},

Participants (144 college students; 67 women, 77 men) completed a questionnaire packet and then were instructed to approach a tarantula. We were unable to replicate Pierce and Kirkpatrick's (1992) findings that men underreport anxiety. Consistent with the literature, women in the study experienced greater anxiety and avoidance compared to men. However, men and women did not differ on physiological reactivity during the first 2min of the BAT. The concordance across avoidance, anxiety and heart rate reactivity differed by gender, suggesting that men and women have different experiences when faced with a fearful object. Furthermore, instrumentality (masculinity) was negatively related to anticipatory anxiety for women but not for men.},

	abstract = {Background
Social inequalities in mental disorders have been described, but studies that explain these inequalities are lacking, especially those using diagnostic interviews. This study investigates the contribution of various explanatory factors to the association between educational level and major depression and generalised anxiety disorder in Irish men and women.
Methods
The study population comprised a national random sample of 5771 women and 4207 men aged 18 or more in Ireland (SLÁN 2007 survey). Major depression and generalised anxiety disorder were measured using a standardised diagnostic interview (CIDI-SF). Four groups of explanatory factors were explored: material, psychosocial, and behavioural factors, and chronic disease.
Results
For both genders, low educational level increased the risk of both mental disorders. Material factors, especially no private health insurance, but also no car, housing tenure, insufficient food budget, and unemployment (for men), made the highest contribution (stronger for men than for women) in explaining the association between education and both mental disorders. Psychosocial (especially formal social participation, social support and marital status) and behavioural factors (smoking and physical activity for both genders, and alcohol and drug use for men) and chronic disease made low independent contributions in explaining the association between education and both mental disorders.
Limitations
Given the cross-sectional study design, no causal conclusion could be drawn.
Conclusions
Targeting various material, psychosocial, and behavioural factors, as well as chronic diseases may help to reduce educational differences in depression and anxiety in the general population.},

	abstract = {Children of mentally ill parents are at high risk of developing problems themselves. They are often identified and approached as a homogeneous group, despite diversity in parental diagnoses. Some studies demonstrate evidence for transgenerational equifinality (children of parents with various disorders are at risk of similar problems) and multifinality (children are at risk of a broad spectrum of problems). At the same time, other studies indicate transgenerational specificity (child problems are specifically related to the parent’s diagnosis) and concordance (children are mainly at risk of the same disorder as their parent). Better insight into the similarities and differences between children of parents with various mental disorders is needed and may inform the development and evaluation of future preventive interventions for children and their families. Accordingly, we systematically compared 76 studies on diagnoses in children of parents with the most prevalent axis I disorders: unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. Methodological characteristics of the studies were compared, and outcomes were analyzed for the presence of transgenerational equifinality, multifinality, specificity, and concordance. Also, the strengths of the relationships between child and parent diagnoses were investigated. This review showed that multifinality and equifinality appear to be more of a characteristic of children of unipolar and bipolar parents than of children of anxious parents, whose risk is mainly restricted to developing anxiety disorders. For all children, risk transmission is assumed to be partly specific since the studies indicate a strong tendency for children to develop the same disorder as their parent.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a global concern, but diverse physical activity measures in use prevent international comparisons. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was developed as an instrument for cross-national monitoring of physical activity and inactivity.
METHODS: Between 1997 and 1998, an International Consensus Group developed four long and four short forms of the IPAQ instruments (administered by telephone interview or self-administration, with two alternate reference periods, either the "last 7 d" or a "usual week" of recalled physical activity). During 2000, 14 centers from 12 countries collected reliability and/or validity data on at least two of the eight IPAQ instruments. Test-retest repeatability was assessed within the same week. Concurrent (inter-method) validity was assessed at the same administration, and criterion IPAQ validity was assessed against the CSA (now MTI) accelerometer. Spearman's correlation coefficients are reported, based on the total reported physical activity.
RESULTS: Overall, the IPAQ questionnaires produced repeatable data (Spearman's rho clustered around 0.8), with comparable data from short and long forms. Criterion validity had a median rho of about 0.30, which was comparable to most other self-report validation studies. The "usual week" and "last 7 d" reference periods performed similarly, and the reliability of telephone administration was similar to the self-administered mode.
CONCLUSIONS: The IPAQ instruments have acceptable measurement properties, at least as good as other established self-reports. Considering the diverse samples in this study, IPAQ has reasonable measurement properties for monitoring population levels of physical activity among 18- to 65-yr-old adults in diverse settings. The short IPAQ form "last 7 d recall" is recommended for national monitoring and the long form for research requiring more detailed assessment.},

Methods: The SCAARED was adapted from the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders. Participants (N=336) ages 18–27 years old were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID). The SCAARED was completed at or within two-weeks before the SCID. The psychometrics of the SCAARED were analyzed using standard statistical analyses including principal components, and Receiver Operant Curve analyses. A replication was performed in an age/sex matched independent sample (N=158).
Results: The SCAARED showed four factors: somatic/panic/agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, and social anxiety. The total and each factor scores demonstrated good internal consistency (α=0.86−0.97) and good discriminant validity between anxiety and other disorders and within anxiety disorders for generalized and social anxiety.

PARTICIPANTS: One thousand and 47 participants, recruited from drug treatment (n = 350) and primary health care (PHC) settings (n = 697), were administered a battery of instruments.
MEASUREMENTS: Measures included the ASSIST; the Addiction Severity Index-Lite (ASI-Lite); the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS); the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI-Plus); the Rating of Injection Site Condition (RISC); the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST); the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT); the Revised Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (RTQ); and the Maudsley Addiction Profile (MAP).
FINDINGS: Concurrent validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between ASSIST scores and scores from the ASI-Lite (r = 0.76-0.88), SDS (r = 0.59), AUDIT (r = 0.82) and RTQ (r = 0.78); and significantly greater ASSIST scores for those with MINI-Plus diagnoses of abuse or dependence (P {\textless} 0.001). Construct validity was established by significant correlations between ASSIST scores and measures of risk factors for the development of drug and alcohol problems (r = 0.48-0.76). Discriminative validity was established by the capacity of the ASSIST to discriminate between substance use, abuse and dependence. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to establish cut-off scores with suitable specificities (50-96\%) and sensitivities (54-97\%) for most substances.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated that the ASSIST is a valid screening test for identifying psychoactive substance use in individuals who use a number of substances and have varying degrees of substance use.},

The lifetime and 12-month male:female prevalence ratios of any anxiety disorder were 1:1.7 and 1:1.79, respectively. Women had higher rates of lifetime diagnosis for each of the anxiety disorders examined, except for social anxiety disorder which showed no gender difference in prevalence. No gender differences were observed in the age of onset and chronicity of the illness. However, women with a lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disorder were more likely than men to also be diagnosed with another anxiety disorder, bulimia nervosa, and major depressive disorder. Furthermore, anxiety disorders were associated with a greater illness burden in women than in men, particularly among European American women and to some extend also among Hispanic women. These results suggest that anxiety disorders are not only more prevalent but also more disabling in women than in men.},

	abstract = {Objective
We assessed the validity of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC) as a screen for depression in Rwandan children and adolescents. Although the CES-DC is widely used for depression screening in high-income countries, its validity in low-income and culturally diverse settings, including sub-Saharan Africa, is unknown.

Method
The CES-DC was selected based on alignment with local expressions of depression-like problems in Rwandan children and adolescents. To examine criterion validity, we compared CES-DC scores to depression diagnoses on a structured diagnostic interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children (MINI KID), in a sample of 367 Rwandan children and adolescents aged 10 through 17 years. Caregiver and child or adolescent self-reports endorsing the presence of local depression-like problems agahinda kenshi (persistent sorrow) and kwiheba (severe hopelessness) were also examined for agreement with MINI KID diagnosis.

Results
The CES-DC exhibited good internal reliability (α = .86) and test-retest reliability (r = .85). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the CES-DC was 0.825 when compared to MINI KID diagnoses, indicating a strong ability to distinguish between depressed and nondepressed children and adolescents in Rwanda. A cut point of ≥ 30 corresponded with a sensitivity of 81.9\% and a specificity of 71.9\% in this referred sample. MINI KID diagnosis was well aligned with local expressions of depression-like problems.

Conclusion
The CES-DC demonstrates good psychometric properties for clinical screening and evaluation in Rwanda, and should be considered for use in this and other low-resource settings. Population samples are needed to determine a generalizable cut point in nonreferred samples.},

METHODS: Relevant studies of the BDI-II were retrieved through a search of electronic databases, a hand search, and contact with authors. Retained studies (k = 118) were allocated into three groups: non-clinical, psychiatric/institutionalized, and medical samples.
RESULTS: The internal consistency was described as around 0.9 and the retest reliability ranged from 0.73 to 0.96. The correlation between BDI-II and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-I) was high and substantial overlap with measures of depression and anxiety was reported. The criterion-based validity showed good sensitivity and specificity for detecting depression in comparison to the adopted gold standard. However, the cutoff score to screen for depression varied according to the type of sample. Factor analysis showed a robust dimension of general depression composed by two constructs: cognitive-affective and somatic-vegetative.
CONCLUSIONS: The BDI-II is a relevant psychometric instrument, showing high reliability, capacity to discriminate between depressed and non-depressed subjects, and improved concurrent, content, and structural validity. Based on available psychometric evidence, the BDI-II can be viewed as a cost-effective questionnaire for measuring the severity of depression, with broad applicability for research and clinical practice worldwide.},

This report describes the new instrument as well as a study of its reliability and feasibility.
SETTING: The study was conducted at participating sites in Australia, Brazil, Ireland, India, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe. Sixty per cent of the sample was recruited from alcohol and drug abuse treatment facilities; the remainder was drawn from general medical settings and psychiatric facilities.
METHODS: The study was concerned primarily with test item reliability, using a simple test-retest procedure to determine whether subjects would respond consistently to the same items when presented in an interview format on two different occasions. Qualitative and quantitative data were also collected to evaluate the feasibility of the screening items and rating format.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 236 volunteer participants completed test and retest interviews at nine collaborating sites. Slightly over half of the sample (53.6\%) was male. The mean age of the sample was 34 years and they had completed, on average, 10 years of education.
RESULTS: The average test-retest reliability coefficients (kappas) ranged from a high of 0.90 (consistency of reporting 'ever' use of substance) to a low of 0.58 (regretted what was done under influence of substance). The average kappas for substance classes ranged from 0.61 for sedatives to 0.78 for opioids. In general, the reliabilities were in the range of good to excellent, with the following items demonstrating the highest kappas across all drug classes: use in the last 3 months, preoccupied with drug use, concern expressed by others, troubled by problems related to drug use, intravenous drug use. Qualitative data collected at the end of the retest interview suggested that the questions were not difficult to answer and were consistent with patients' expectations for a health interview. The data were used to guide the selection of a smaller set of items that can serve as the basis for more extensive validation research.
CONCLUSION: The ASSIST items are reliable and feasible to use as part of an international screening test. Further evaluation of the screening test should be conducted.},

As such, anxiety is an adaptive emotion that prepares the individual to detect and deal with threats, thereby fostering survival (Marks \& Nesse, 1994). However, high levels of anxiety have strong potential to interfere with development, raising risk for a wide range of maladaptive outcomes, including impaired interpersonal and academic functioning (Rapee, Schniering, \& Hudson, 2009).

	abstract = {Background: Depression is a burdensome, recurring mental health disorder with high prevalence. Even in developed countries, patients have to wait for several months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and providing context-sensitive intervention support. Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold, first to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on sensor information to identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level, second to explore the potential of context sensitive intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms. Methods: A total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS), collecting context-sensitive sensor information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive behavior therapy. Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each subject’s preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to time, location, and personal preference. Biweekly, participants were asked to complete a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9) to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between adherence and change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based on smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer, Wifi, and global positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models used these features to infer behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention delivery. Results: A total of 36 subjects used MOSS for ≥2 weeks. For subjects with clinical depression (PHQ-9≥11) at baseline and adherence ≥8 weeks (n=12), a significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative trend between adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=−.498, P=.099). Binary classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples (n=143), with a cutoff of PHQ-9≥11, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross validation resulted in 60.1\% and 59.1\% accuracy, respectively. Conclusions: Proxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver context-sensitive and personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used the app for an extended period of time showed significant reduction in self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on features extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi, accelerometer, GPS, and phone use, demonstrated a proof of concept for the detection of depression superior to random classification. While findings of effectiveness must be reproduced in a RCT to proof causation, they pave the way for a new generation of digital health interventions leveraging smartphone sensors to provide context sensitive information for in-situ support and unobtrusive monitoring of critical mental health states.},

	abstract = {Background: Altering components of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures to better suit the purposes of individual studies is a common and oftentimes necessary step. Though the inherent flexibility in EMA has its benefits, no resource exists to provide an overview of the variability in how convergent constructs and symptoms have been assessed in the past. The present study fills that gap by examining EMA measurement design for mood and anxiety symptomatology.Methods: Various search engines were used to identify 234 relevant studies. Items administered, data collection schedules (i.e., beeps per day), response scales (i.e., Likert), data collection platforms (i.e., apps), and psychometric properties (i.e., reliability) were extracted.Results: Study designs varied greatly in all aspects across the identified papers. Over 4,600 extracted items were qualitatively analyzed, resulting in the identification of 12 themes. The most EMA items focused on affect, with categories such as “happiness” and “tension” appearing most frequently. We provide all of our data extraction in the format of an open-source database.Limitations: Despite our best attempts to include as much of the relevant literature as possible, this review and the accompanying database are not exhaustive, but can easily be built upon to include other, newer studies.Conclusions: The fact that the affect theme featured both positive and negative emotional constructs highlights the dichotomous focus on valence and affect within the literature surrounding anxious and depressive symptomatology. We hope that our database will act as a helpful design decision-making resource for researchers studying this kind of symptomatology in the future.Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42019139409).},

	abstract = {Existing evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while effective for many fear-based traumas, do not sufficiently target the unique phenomenology of psychological wounds stemming from combat, specifically, moral injury and traumatic loss. The experience of moral injury and loss cause deeply complex challenges across multiple domains—behavioral, biological, cognitive, social, and spiritual—in ways that are significantly different from danger-based harms. Adaptive disclosure, a new psychotherapy, was specifically designed to address this gap in treatment and help service members and veterans begin the process of healing from combat stress and trauma. This chapter presents the conceptual foundation and change agents for adaptive disclosure along with the case of a new veteran whose principal harm was moral injury complicated by loss. The patient in this case made modest gains in PTSD symptom severity alongside authentic cognitive and behavioral signs of increased agency, proactivity, hopefulness, and vitality that were clear departures from moral injury, suggesting the utility of this treatment approach in addressing the psychological wounds of war.},

The present study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and response to cognitive processing therapy (CPT) among a sample of military veterans with PTSD and increased suicide risk. A secondary aim was to provide a clinically useful definition of high suicide risk. Chart review was used to classify the suicide risk level of 290 veterans who participated in CPT at a Veterans Affairs clinic. Treatment outcomes in veterans with different suicide risk levels were also gathered and compared. Over 50\% (n = 155) of the sample demonstrated increased suicide risk, and 1.0\% (n = 3) engaged in suicidal behavior after initiating treatment. To date, hospital records show no suicide deaths since 2016 among clinic patients who received CPT. Suicide risk level was not associated with CPT tolerability, and PTSD symptom change was equivalent across groups, ps = .085–.976. Veterans across groups reported clinically significant reductions in PTSD symptoms. The tested suicide risk categorization schemes performed similarly in differentiating the odds of CPT completion and PTSD symptom reduction. These results suggest that veterans with PTSD and an increased risk of suicide, including those with previous suicide attempts and current ideation, can tolerate and benefit from CPT. Additional variables must be considered to truly determine the acute and imminent suicide risk that would deem CPT to be contraindicated.},

	abstract = {Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Moral Injury (ACT-MI; 10–11), is an application of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy principles designed to help individuals live their values, even in the presence of moral pain. ACT-MI differs from other emerging treatments for moral injury in that ACT-MI is not based on a traditional syndromal approach to conceptualizing moral injury, which treats moral injury as a collection of signs and symptoms to be reduced. Rather than assuming moral injury causes suffering through a constellation of symptoms that a person has, in ACT-MI, moral injury is defined by what a person does in response to moral pain. Consistent with this framework, we present a unique approach to moral injury case conceptualization that emphasizes function over form, providing clients the opportunity to break free from the patterns of behavior that cause moral injury-related suffering to persist. Rooted in approaches to conceptualizing that have demonstrated utility in extant interventions (e.g., ACT), ACT-MI clinicians conduct ongoing functional analyses to inform case conceptualization and intervention. Functional analysis is used to disrupt the processes maintaining moral injury, as the client and therapist work to identify and intervene on the behaviors reinforcing avoidance and control of painful internal experiences causing moral injury. In the current article, we guide the reader through a framework for applying functional analysis to the conceptualization of moral injury where the reinforcers driving moral injury are explored. We also provide examples of questions that can be used to help uncover the functions of moral injury consistent behavior. Case examples based on our experiences treating moral injury are presented to demonstrate how various types of morally injurious events can evoke different features of moral pain which in turn motivate different repertoires of avoidance and control. These inflexible patterns of avoidance and control create suffering by engaging in behavior designed to escape moral pain, such as social isolation, spiritual disconnection, reduced self-care, suicidal ideation, and substance use. We discuss how to target this suffering using functional analysis to guide treatment decisions, matching interventional processes within ACT-MI to the specific functions that moral injury-related behavior is serving for an individual. We suggest that the use of functional analytic case formulation procedures described herein can assist clients in disrupting behavioral patterns maintaining moral injury and thereby free them to pursue lives of greater meaning and purpose.},

	abstract = {Objective: Language patterns may elucidate mechanisms of mental health conditions. To inform underlying theory and risk models, we evaluated prospective associations between in vivo text messaging language and differential symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety.
Methods: Over 16 weeks, we collected outgoing text messages from 335 adults. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), NRC Emotion Lexicon, and previously established depression and stress dictionaries, we evaluated the degree to which language features predict symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, or social anxiety the following week using hierarchical linear models. To isolate the specificity of language effects, we also controlled for the effects of the two other symptom types.
Results: We found significant relationships of language features, including personal pronouns, negative emotion, cognitive and biological processes, and informal language, with common mental health conditions, including depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety (ps {\textless} .05). There was substantial overlap between language features and the three mental health outcomes. However, after controlling for other symptoms in the models, depressive symptoms were uniquely negatively associated with language about anticipation, trust, social processes, and affiliation (βs: −.10 to −.09, ps {\textless} .05), whereas generalized anxiety symptoms were positively linked with these same language features (βs: .12–.13, ps {\textless} .001). Social anxiety symptoms were uniquely associated with anger, sexual language, and swearing (βs: .12–.13, ps {\textless} .05).
Conclusion: Language that confers both common (e.g., personal pronouns and negative emotion) and specific (e.g., affiliation, anticipation, trust, and anger) risk for affective disorders is perceptible in prior week text messages, holding promise for understanding cognitive‐behavioral mechanisms and tailoring digital interventions.},

N = 7 young adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 


Research Question: Can eye-tracking metrics predict unsafe driving at intersection crosswalks in young adults with mild cognitive impairment? 


Findings: Gaze transition entropy, gaze variability, and pupil size entropy predict safe crosses. 


Limitations: Clearly there’s internal validity. Now need assessments of external validity. 


Methods
Participants.


N = 7 young adults. 


Minimum 2 years driving experience. 


Mean age 22.57, SD = 2.99; 2 male. 


Driving Simulator


Virage Simulation VS500M. 


Consists of 3 55” screens arranged for 180 degree view, with in-built rearview mirrors and surround sound. 


Eye Tracker


SMI Eye Tracking Glasses 1. 


Record eye movements at binocular 60Hz rate, 960 x 720 pix. resolution.


Procedure


Participants assessed for simulator sickness (presumably a form of motion sickness) before and after simulator tests, using Mini Simulator Sickness Questionnaire.


5 non-scored warm-up trials.


Note: Presumably this means the participants were not informed if they made an error? 


Apparently the practice trials ascended in difficulty, so presumably that means there were 3 practice trials for the hard condition? 




Task consisted of 15 test trials. 


Task details: 


Task: Cross a “busy” four-lane intersection, at 3 levels of difficulty (five trials each). 


If you don’t corss within a minute, that is a failure and with 3 failures to cross you will have to reset the set of 10 trials.


Note: Above, it says the driving task is 15 trials with 3 levels of difficulty. Were participants really told it would lead to a reset of 10 trials? 




Driver didn’t need to turn or use brakes since screen just faded to black at other side of intersection. 




Conditions:


Easy: One active lane of vehicle traffic each going right and one left. 


Medium: Two active lanes in each direction.


Hard: All four lanes of traffic occupied and pedestrians moving in both directions (no pedestrians in previous conditions). 




Note: It says “Three 3s gaps were programmed in each of the trials for all three levels of difficulty”. Not clear if that means 3 second gaps between cars, between levels of difficulty, or what. Must be gaps between levels of difficulty, so that a 3sec gap between trials implies a change to a new level of difficulty? 


One car behind the driver, which would honk after 45 seconds of inactivity. 


15 test trials presented in random order of difficulty (unlike practice trials, which ascended in difficulty). 


Scoring: 


Outcomes were: 


Safe crossing


Forced crossing. 


Near crash. 


Crash. 




Categorized in terms of how much time participants had between their car and colliding with the other car. 


Note: Presumably “forced crossing” means crossing at a distance which is sketchy but not entirely unsafe? A distance which is technically safe but which could’ve been judged otherwise? Unclear. 




Outcomes dichotomized into safe vs unsafe to maximize power and to fit into logistic regression. 


Note: I kind of doubt there’s enough trials here to get good power anyway. 








Eye tracking: 


SMI’s BeGaze software trichotimizes eye movement events: fixations, saccades, and blinks. 


Trial Duration:


Manually determined by the experimenter, by reviewing eye tracking videos to see first frame at which the simulation was visible. 


End of trial was deemed as final frame before collision, or final frame when first line of the far crosswalk was visible, or after which time the vehicle was considered to have crossed successfuly. 




Metrics: 


Fixations: Calculated fixation rate per minute, mean fixation duration (ms).


Measures of gaze variability: 


Population standard deviation of X and Y coordinates (in pixels) of each fixation during the trial. 


Stationary gaze entropy (SGE) and gaze transition entropy (GTE). 






Area of interest (AOIs): Areas of interest calculated in three ways: 


By splitting visual field vertically into three areas (areas above the bottom third of the screen): 


By splitting the visual field vertically into five areas (areas above the bottom third of the screen).

	abstract = {Objectives: Derived from classical conditioning theory and rooted in motivational mechanisms, cue reactivity paradigms (CRPs) are used in addictions research to measure participants’ propensities for substance-relevant responses (e.g., craving) during exposure to substancerelevant cues (e.g., drug paraphernalia). CRPs are also useful in PTSD-addiction research, allowing the study of affective and substance-relevant responses to trauma cues. However, studies using traditional CRPs are time-consuming with high attrition rates due to repeat testing. Thus, we sought to test whether a single session semi-structured trauma interview could serve as a CRP in terms of eliciting theorized cue exposure effects on craving and affect measures.
Method: Fifty regular cannabis users with trauma histories provided detailed descriptions of their most traumatic lifetime experience, and a neutral experience, according to an established interview protocol (Sinha \& Tuit, 2012). Linear mixed models examined the effect of cue type (trauma vs. neutral) on affective and craving responses.
Results: As hypothesized, the trauma interview elicited significantly greater cannabis craving (and alcohol craving among the drinkers), and, greater negative affect among those with more severe PTSD symptoms, compared to the neutral interview.
Conclusion: Results suggest Sinha and Tuit’s (2012) semi-structured interview may function effectively as a CRP for use in trauma and addictions research.},

contribute to comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and cannabis use disorder. This phenomenon can be studied experimentally by combining the trauma cue reactivity paradigm (CRP) with cannabis-related cognitive processing tasks. In this study, we used a computerized cannabis approach-avoidance task (AAT) to assess automatic cannabis (vs. neutral) approach bias following personalized trauma (vs. neutral) CRP exposure. We hypothesized that selective cannabis (vs. neutral) approach biases on the AAT would be larger among participants with higher PTSD symptom severity, particularly following trauma (vs. neutral) cue exposure. We used a within-subjects experimental design with a continuous between-subjects moderator (PTSD symptom severity). Participants were exposed to both a trauma and neutral CRP in random order, completing a cannabis AAT (cannabis vs. neutral stimuli) following each cue exposure. Current cannabis users with histories of psychological trauma (n=50; 34\% male; mean age=37.8 years) described their most traumatic lifetime event, and a similarly-detailed neutral event, according to an established interview protocol that served as the CRP. As hypothesized, an AAT stimulus type x PTSD symptom severity interaction emerged (p=.042) with approach bias greater to cannabis than neutral stimuli for participants with higher (p=.006), but not lower (p=0.36), PTSD symptom severity. Contrasting expectations, the stimulus type x PTSD symptoms effect was not intensified by trauma cue exposure (p=0.19). Selective cannabis approach bias may be chronically activated in cannabis users with higher PTSD symptom severity and may serve as an automatic cognitive mechanism to help explain PTSD-CUD co- morbidity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To use a risk and resilience approach to examine the association between social media use and mental health among transgender, gender nonbinary, and cisgender youths. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study analyzed data collected from an online survey between May and August 2021. Participants included a random sample of US youths; eligibility requirements included being aged 10 to 17 years and residing in the US. Statistical analysis was performed from February to April 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Social media use (time, type of use, favorite site, social comparisons, mindfulness, taking intentional breaks, cleaning and curating feeds, problematic use, and media literacy programs at their school) and mental health (depression, emotional problems, conduct problems, and body image) as main outcomes.
RESULTS Participants included 1231 youths aged 10 to 17 years from a national quota sample from the United States; 675 (54.8\%) identified as cisgender female, 479 (38.9\%) as cisgender male, and 77 (6.3\%) as transgender, gender nonbinary, or other; 4 (0.3\%) identified as American Indian or Alaska Native, 111 (9.0\%) as Asian, 185 (15.0\%) as Black, 186 (15.1\%) as Hispanic or Latinx, 1 (0.1\%) as Pacific Islander, 703 (57.1\%) as White, and 41 (3.3\%) as mixed and/or another race or ethnicity. Gender identity moderated both the strength and the direction of multiple associations between social media practices and mental health: active social media use (eg, emotional problems: B = 1.82; 95\% CI, 0.16 to 3.49; P = .03), cleaning and/or curating social media feeds (eg, depression: B = −0.91; 95\% CI, −1.98 to −0.09; P = .03), and taking intentional breaks (eg, depression: B = 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.14 to 1.92; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study of gender identity, social media, and mental health, gender identity was associated with youths’ experiences of social media in ways that may have distinct implications for mental health. These results suggest that research about social media effects on youths should attend to gender identity; directing children and adolescents to spend less time on social media may backfire for those transgender and gender nonbinary youths who are intentional about creating safe spaces on social media that may not exist in their offline world.},

The present study investigated relationships be­ tween COVID-19-pandemic-related stress and PUSM and possible moderating effects of motives for using social media (positive and/or negative reinforcement) during and following a COVID-19-pandemic-related lockdown. Six-hundred-and-sixty participants initially completed a survey including self-report measures of PUSM, COVID19-pandemic-related stress, and motives for using social media (i.e., for negative reinforcement involving coping and conformity or positive reinforcements involving enhancement and social motives). During the COVID-19 outbreak recovery period, 117 participants again completed the survey. Bayesian analyses revealed that PUSM was associated with higher COVID-19-pandemic-related stress levels and use of social media for coping, conformity, and enhancement purposes. Longitudinally, PUSM symptom worsening was associated with increased use of social media for coping motives regardless of levels of perceived stress. Use of social media for conformity and enhancement purposes moderated relationships between stress levels during lockdown and PUSM symptoms worsening after lockdown. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that negative reinforcement processes may be key factors in PUSM symptom worsening regardless of perceived stress. Concurrently, high levels of stress may worsen PUSM through positive reinforcement processes.},

Objective: This study seeks to systematically examine problematic social media use in youth and its association with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.
Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify studies in adolescents and young adults, using the databases Engineering Village, Psycinfo, Pubmed, and Web of Science. A total of 18 studies were identified, with a total of 9269 participants in our review and included in the meta-analysis.
Results: Our metaregression shows moderate but statistically significant correlations between problematic social media use and depression (r=0.273, P{\textless}.001), anxiety (r=0.348, P{\textless}.001), and stress (r=0.313, P{\textless}.001). We did not find evidence of heterogeneity of these summary correlations by age, gender, or year of publication.
Conclusions: This study provides further evidence of the association between problematic social media use and negative mental health among adolescents and young adults and supports future research to focus on the underlying mechanisms of problematic use of social media.},

	abstract = {Problematic social media use (PSMU) refers to excessive uncontrolled use of social media which impacts upon daily functioning (Blackwell et al., 2017). Self-regulation is central to the development and experience of PSMU, and conceptually interrelates with individual usage motivations (Reinecke et al., 2022). While there is a growing body of research on social media use motivations, how usage motivations and self-regulation combined influence PSMU is not well understood. There are also persistent questions around the effectiveness of addiction-based measures of PSMU. The quantitative component of this nested mixed-methods study (N = 607) employed hierarchical regression and structural equation modelling, principally identifying that impulsive social media usage mediates the pathway between perceived executive/attentional functioning and the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS, Andreassen et al., 2012, 2016), a popular tool used to measure PSMU. In contrast, social-engagement motivations had a negative influence on the BSMAS. The qualitative component, comprising interview/open-ended questionnaire, explored individual experiences self-regulating social media use. Participants (N = 24) were recruited from the survey study, based on meeting screening criteria for executive dysfunction (Adult Self-Report ADHD Scale, Kessler et al., 2005), with sub-groups defined by top and bottom quartile BSMAS scores (evenly grouped). Thematic analysis found that most individuals with attention dysregulation, regardless of their BSMAS category, perceive self-regulation of social media use as highly challenging and effortful, describing broadly problematic relationship with social media. They also described rich combination of motivations and context of using social media, and strategies for managing use. This research questions the effectiveness of the BSMAS as a measure of general PSMU (lacking a formed self-regulation component), especially in individuals with attentional dysregulation. Future research investigating self-regulation strategies and focusing on characteristics of positive social media use is needed.},

Results indicated that 6.68\% (n = 39) of all respondents could be potentially classed as problematic users. Moreover, further analysis indicated that intrapersonal motive (β = 0.38), negative affect (β = 0.22), daily social media use (β = 0.18), surveillance motive (β = 0.12), and positive affect (β = −0.09) each predicted PSMU. These variables accounted for about 37\% of the total variance in PSMU, with intrapersonal motive driving the greatest predictive contribution, over and above the effects of patterns of social media use and sociodemographic variables.

Attention may mediate this eﬀect by speeding the processing of the attended end of the line; however, apparent motion mechanisms between the cue and the line may also contribute. This study uses a new type of attentional cue, reﬂexive gaze orienting (RGO), which recruits attention automatically but uses a cue presented remotely from the line. Thus, RGO rules out motion mechanisms that might be recruited by a cue appearing in the vicinity of the line, and allows one to evaluate the contribution of attention per se to the illusion. In three experiments, RGO induced the line-motion illusion, establishing attention as a source of the illusion. Although attention may accelerate processing at the attended location, alternative mechanisms by which attention could cause the line-motion illusion are considered.},

Real motion is used to cancel ILM, providing three measures to quantify ILM: the consistency of responding to only ILM in the absence of real motion; the distance between the points of subjective equality between ILM and the real motion; and the area between the curves relating perception of motion to the real and illusory conditions. ILM quantities for onset and offset bars are strongly correlated when the bar change occurs after the flash. However, onset bars presented during the flash do not show any evidence of ILM, whereas offset bars removed during the flash result in reverse ILM (rILM). Moreover, rILM and ILM are not correlated, suggesting they reflect two separate illusions. These results are consistent over the various measures of ILM.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Attentional bias, the automatic selective attentional orientation towards drug-related stimuli is well demonstrated in substance users. However, attentional bias studies of cannabis users speciﬁcally have thus far been inconclusive. Thus, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the currently available literature regarding cannabis related attentional bias in cannabis users.
Methods: Literature search and selection was carried out, following the PRISMA guidelines, with all included studies investigating the relationship between cannabis use and attentional bias towards cannabis cues.
Results: Fourteen manuscripts, reporting on 1271 participants (cannabis users n = 1044; controls n = 217), were considered for the systematic-review and majority were included in a meta-analysis. Studies reviewed used three types of attentional bias tasks: pictorial stimuli, word stimuli, and non-cannabis stimuli tasks. Greater attentional bias towards cannabis pictures (d = 0.42, P {\textless} 0.0001) and words (d = 0.63, P = 0.03) as well as both types of stimuli overall (d = 0.53, P {\textless} 0.0001) was observed in cannabis users compared to controls, though there was evidence of signiﬁcant heterogeneity for both word stimuli and overall meta-analysis. Bigger eﬀect sizes were associated with shorter durations of exposure to cannabis stimuli suggesting mainly automatic orientating rather than controlled attention processing.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings suggest that cannabis users display greater attentional bias towards cannabis cues, likely an automatic process, than control groups. Future studies employing shorter exposure durations may validate attentional bias as a treatment target for the development of interventions in people with cannabis use disorder.},

	abstract = {Background: In the current study, we investigated whether the internal reliability of the visual probe task measure of attentional bias for substance-related cues could be improved by incorporating eye-tracking methods and personalised stimuli.
Method: Sixty social drinkers completed two visual probe tasks: one with a broad range of different alcohol pictures, the other containing only images of the participants’ preferred drink. Attentional bias was inferred from manual reaction times to probes replacing the pictures, and from the duration of eye movement ﬁxations towards the pictures (gaze dwell time).
Results: Internal reliability was highest for personalised (versus general) alcohol stimuli, and for eyetracking (versus manual reaction time) measures of attentional bias. The internal reliability of both reaction time (˛ = .73) and gaze dwell time measures (˛ = .76) of attentional bias for personalised alcohol stimuli was acceptable. Internal reliability of indices of attentional bias for general alcohol stimuli was inferior, although better for the gaze dwell time (˛ = .51) compared to the reaction time measure (˛ = .19). Attentional bias towards personalised stimuli was larger than bias to general stimuli, but only for the reaction time measure. There were no statistically signiﬁcant associations between measures of attentional bias and alcohol consumption or craving.
Conclusions: Adopting personalised stimuli and eye movement monitoring signiﬁcantly improves the internal reliability of the alcohol-related visual probe task. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing attention control training (ACT) and attention bias modification (ABM) in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have shown mixed results. The current RCT extends the extant literature by comparing the efficacy of ACT and a novel bias-contingent-ABM (BC-ABM), in which direction of training is contingent upon the direction of pre-treatment attention bias (AB), in a sample of civilian patients with PTSD.
Methods. Fifty treatment-seeking civilian patients with PTSD were randomly assigned to either ACT or BC-ABM. Clinician and self-report measures of PTSD and depression, as well as AB and attention bias variability (ABV), were acquired pre- and post-treatment.
Results. ACT yielded greater reductions in PTSD and depressive symptoms on both clinicianrated and self-reported measures compared with BC-ABM. The BC-ABM condition successfully shifted ABs in the intended training direction. In the ACT group, there was no significant change in ABV or AB from pre- to post-treatment.
Conclusions. The current RCT extends previous results in being the first to apply ABM that is contingent upon AB at pre-treatment. This personalized BC-ABM approach is associated with significant reductions in symptoms. However, ACT produces even greater reductions, thereby emerging as a promising treatment for PTSD.},

Results of Experiment 1 (using typical instructions, i.e., instructions that are lenient with regard to eye movements) showed an RT bias, but only in the trials without eye movements The overall RT bias (calculated ‘‘blind’’ for eye movements) was non-significant. In Experiment 2, stricter instructions and small changes in the procedure led to a sharp decrease in the number of eye movements, such that both the RT bias in the trials without eye movements as well as the RT bias across all trials was significant.},

In Experiment 1, we directly compared the two versions of the dot-probe paradigm. With the discrimination task, the bias towards happy faces was replicated. However, the location task yielded a null effect. In Experiment 2, we found a cueing effect with an abrupt onset cue in both tasks. However, for the location task a congruencesequence effect (a typical characteristic of response-priming processes) occurred. This result suggests that in the location task, attentional processes are confounded with response-priming processes. We recommend to generally use discrimination tasks.},

	abstract = {Background: Internalizing disorders are the most common psychiatric problems observed among youth in Canada. Sadly, youth with internalizing disorders often avoid seeking clinical help and rarely receive adequate treatment. Current methods of assessing internalizing disorders usually rely on subjective symptom ratings, but internalizing symptoms are frequently underreported, which creates a barrier to the accurate assessment of these symptoms in youth. Therefore, novel assessment tools that use objective data need to be developed to meet the highest standards of reliability, feasibility, scalability, and affordability. Mobile sensing technologies, which unobtrusively record aspects of youth behaviors in their daily lives with the potential to make inferences about their mental health states, offer a possible method of addressing this assessment barrier.
Objective: This study aims to explore whether passively collected smartphone sensor data can be used to predict internalizing symptoms among youth in Canada.
Methods: In this study, the youth participants (N=122) completed self-report assessments of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Next, the participants installed an app, which passively collected data about their mobility, screen time, sleep, and social interactions over 2 weeks. Then, we tested whether these passive sensor data could be used to predict internalizing symptoms among these youth participants.
Results: More severe depressive symptoms correlated with more time spent stationary (r=0.293; P=.003), less mobility (r=0.271; P=.006), higher light intensity during the night (r=0.227; P=.02), and fewer outgoing calls (r=−0.244; P=.03). In contrast, more severe anxiety symptoms correlated with less time spent stationary (r=−0.249; P=.01) and greater mobility (r=0.234; P=.02). In addition, youths with higher anxiety scores spent more time on the screen (r=0.203; P=.049). Finally, adding passively collected smartphone sensor data to the prediction models of internalizing symptoms significantly improved their fit.
Conclusions: Passively collected smartphone sensor data provide a useful way to monitor internalizing symptoms among youth. Although the results replicated findings from adult populations, to ensure clinical utility, they still need to be replicated in larger samples of youth. The work also highlights intervention opportunities via mobile technology to reduce the burden of internalizing symptoms early on.},

	abstract = {Background
Improving mental health in youth is a major concern. Future approaches to monitor and intervene in youth mental health problems should rely on mobile tools that allow for the daily monitoring of mental health both actively (eg, using ecological momentary assessments [EMAs]) and passively (eg, digital phenotyping) by capturing individuals’ data.

Objective
This umbrella review aims to (1) report the main characteristics of existing reviews on mental health and young people, including mobile approaches to mental health; (2) describe EMAs and trace data and the mental health conditions investigated; (3) report the main results; and (4) outline promises, limitations, and directions for future research.

Methods
A systematic literature search was carried out in 9 scientific databases (Communication \& Mass Media Complete, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, the ProQuest Sociology Database, Web of Science, and PubMed) on January 30, 2022, coupled with a hand search and updated in July 2022. We included (systematic) reviews of EMAs and trace data in the context of mental health, with a specific focus on young populations, including children, adolescents, and young adults. The quality of the included reviews was evaluated using the AMSTAR (Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews) checklist.

Results
After the screening process, 30 reviews (published between 2016 and 2022) were included in this umbrella review, of which 21 (70\%) were systematic reviews and 9 (30\%) were narrative reviews. The included systematic reviews focused on symptoms of depression (5/21, 24\%); bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, or psychosis (6/21, 29\%); general ill-being (5/21, 24\%); cognitive abilities (2/21, 9.5\%); well-being (1/21, 5\%); personality (1/21, 5\%); and suicidal thoughts (1/21, 5\%). Of the 21 systematic reviews, 15 (71\%) summarized studies that used mobile apps for tracing, 2 (10\%) summarized studies that used them for intervention, and 4 (19\%) summarized studies that used them for both intervention and tracing. Mobile tools used in the systematic reviews were smartphones only (8/21, 38\%), smartphones and wearable devices (6/21, 29\%), and smartphones with other tools (7/21, 33\%). In total, 29\% (6/21) of the systematic reviews focused on EMAs, including ecological momentary interventions; 33\% (7/21) focused on trace data; and 38\% (8/21) focused on both. Narrative reviews mainly focused on the discussion of issues related to digital phenotyping, existing theoretical frameworks used, new opportunities, and practical examples.

Conclusions
EMAs and trace data in the context of mental health assessments and interventions are promising tools. Opportunities (eg, using mobile approaches in low- and middle-income countries, integration of multimodal data, and improving self-efficacy and self-awareness on mental health) and limitations (eg, absence of theoretical frameworks, difficulty in assessing the reliability and effectiveness of such approaches, and need to appropriately assess the quality of the studies) were further discussed.

Although central gaze cues cause reflexive orienting, the inhibitory effect that is relatively ubiquitous following exogenous orienting to uninformative peripheral cues has been relatively rare. We hypothesized that IOR might be seen following gazeinduced orienting if attention were effectively returned to centre by a return gaze or return flash. The timecourse of gaze-directed orienting was measured by varying the interval between the gaze cue and a peripheral target requiring an orientation discrimination (permitting measurement of the Simon effect). Significant facilitation was observed at all but the longest SOA tested, 2,880 ms, by which time the facilitation had disappeared with no evidence of IOR. Gazeinduced cuing (which was unaffected by return cue condition) interacted with the Simon effect, decreasing it at the gazed-at location, a pattern that is not seen with more typical endogenous and exogenous cuing.},

	abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence technologies, the high accuracy of machine learning methods has become a non-unique standard. People are beginning to be more concerned about the understandability between humans and machines. The interference procedure of the machines is hoped to accord with human thinking as much as possible, which has spawned the recent and ongoing demands for developing explainable models. The present study proposes a new explainable and persuasive model for machine learning problems by introducing Structural Equation Modelling into the picture. Six parts make up the model, from data collection to model evaluation. The model can be used for data analysis, machine learning, and causal analysis. The proposed model is also transparent and can be interpreted from design to application. A practical experiment shows its effectiveness in a healthcare problem.},

	abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the impact and spread of mental illness and made health services difficult to access; therefore, there is a need for remote, pervasive forms of mental health monitoring. Digital phenotyping is a new approach that uses measures extracted from spontaneous interactions with smartphones (eg, screen touches or movements) or other digital devices as markers of mental status.
Objective: This review aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using digital phenotyping for predicting relapse or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with mental disorders through a systematic review of the scientific literature.
Methods: Our research was carried out using 2 bibliographic databases (PubMed and Scopus) by searching articles published up to January 2023. By following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) guidelines, we started from an initial pool of 1150 scientific papers and screened and extracted a final sample of 29 papers, including studies concerning clinical populations in the field of mental health, which were aimed at predicting relapse or exacerbation of symptoms. The systematic review has been registered on the web registry Open Science Framework.
Results: We divided the results into 4 groups according to mental disorder: schizophrenia (9/29, 31\%), mood disorders (15/29, 52\%), anxiety disorders (4/29, 14\%), and substance use disorder (1/29, 3\%). The results for the first 3 groups showed that several features (ie, mobility, location, phone use, call log, heart rate, sleep, head movements, facial and vocal characteristics, sociability, social rhythms, conversations, number of steps, screen on or screen off status, SMS text message logs, peripheral skin temperature, electrodermal activity, light exposure, and physical activity), extracted from data collected via the smartphone and wearable wristbands, can be used to create digital phenotypes that could support gold-standard assessment and could be used to predict relapse or symptom exacerbations.
Conclusions: Thus, as the data were consistent for almost all the mental disorders considered (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia), the feasibility of this approach was confirmed. In the future, a new model of health care management using digital devices should be integrated with the digital phenotyping approach and tailored mobile interventions (managing crises during relapse or exacerbation).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental illness characterized by persistent sadness and a loss of interest in activities. Using smartphones and wearable devices to monitor the mental condition of patients with MDD has been examined in several studies. However, few studies have used passively collected data to monitor mood changes over time.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of monitoring mood status and stability of patients with MDD using machine learning models trained by passively collected data, including phone use data, sleep data, and step count data.
METHODS: We constructed 950 data samples representing time spans during three consecutive Patient Health Questionnaire-9 assessments. Each data sample was labeled as Steady or Mood Swing, with subgroups Steady-remission, Steady-depressed, Mood Swing-drastic, and Mood Swing-moderate based on patients' Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores from three visits. A total of 252 features were extracted, and 4 feature selection models were applied; 6 different combinations of types of data were experimented with using 6 different machine learning models.
RESULTS: A total of 334 participants with MDD were enrolled in this study. The highest average accuracy of classification between Steady and Mood Swing was 76.67\% (SD 8.47\%) and that of recall was 90.44\% (SD 6.93\%), with features from all types of data being used. Among the 6 combinations of types of data we experimented with, the overall best combination was using call logs, sleep data, step count data, and heart rate data. The accuracies of predicting between Steady-remission and Mood Swing-drastic, Steady-remission and Mood Swing-moderate, and Steady-depressed and Mood Swing-drastic were over 80\%, and the accuracy of predicting between Steady-depressed and Mood Swing-moderate and the overall Steady to Mood Swing classification accuracy were over 75\%. Comparing all 6 aforementioned combinations, we found that the overall prediction accuracies between Steady-remission and Mood Swing (drastic and moderate) are better than those between Steady-depressed and Mood Swing (drastic and moderate).
CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method could be used to monitor mood changes in patients with MDD with promising accuracy by using passively collected data, which can be used as a reference by doctors for adjusting treatment plans or for warning patients and their guardians of a relapse.

Our novel approach is a feature extraction technique that allows us to select meaningful features indicative of depressive symptoms from longitudinal data. It allows us to detect the presence of post-semester depressive symptoms with an accuracy of 85.7\% and change in symptom severity with an accuracy of 85.4\%. It also predicts these outcomes with an accuracy of {\textgreater}80\%, 11–15 weeks before the end of the semester, allowing ample time for pre-emptive interventions. Our work has significant implications for the detection of health outcomes using longitudinal behavioral data and limited ground truth. By detecting change and predicting symptoms several weeks before their onset, our work also has implications for preventing depression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Virtually, all organisms on Earth have their own circadian rhythm, and humans are no exception. Circadian rhythms are associated with various human states, especially mood disorders, and disturbance of the circadian rhythm is known to be very closely related. Attempts have also been made to derive clinical implications associated with mood disorders using the vast amounts of digital log that is acquired by digital technologies develop and using computational analysis techniques.
OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the mood state or episode, activity, sleep, light exposure, and heart rate during a period of about 2 years by acquiring various digital log data through wearable devices and smartphone apps as well as conventional clinical assessments. We investigated a mood prediction algorithm developed with machine learning using passive data phenotypes based on circadian rhythms.
METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study on 55 patients with mood disorders (major depressive disorder [MDD] and bipolar disorder type 1 [BD I] and 2 [BD II]) for 2 years. A smartphone app for self-recording daily mood scores and detecting light exposure (using the installed sensor) were provided. From daily worn activity trackers, digital log data of activity, sleep, and heart rate were collected. Passive digital phenotypes were processed into 130 features based on circadian rhythms, and a mood prediction algorithm was developed by random forest.
RESULTS: The mood state prediction accuracies for the next 3 days in all patients, MDD patients, BD I patients, and BD II patients were 65\%, 65\%, 64\%, and 65\% with 0.7, 0.69, 0.67, and 0.67 area under the curve (AUC) values, respectively. The accuracies of all patients for no episode (NE), depressive episode (DE), manic episode (ME), and hypomanic episode (HME) were 85.3\%, 87\%, 94\%, and 91.2\% with 0.87, 0.87, 0.958, and 0.912 AUC values, respectively. The prediction accuracy in BD II patients was distinctively balanced as high showing 82.6\%, 74.4\%, and 87.5\% of accuracy (with generally good sensitivity and specificity) with 0.919, 0.868, and 0.949 AUC values for NE, DE, and HME, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the theoretical basis of chronobiology, this study proposed a good model for future research by developing a mood prediction algorithm using machine learning by processing and reclassifying digital log data. In addition to academic value, it is expected that this study will be of practical help to improve the prognosis of patients with mood disorders by making it possible to apply actual clinical application owing to the rapid expansion of digital technology.},

The primary purpose of the current study was to see if we could replicate these findings of slippage and if we did, to use individual differences to explore relationships between slippage in the temporal and spatial domains. The participants identified and localized targets in visual search and in RSVP sequences. In Experiment 1, we used visual search and RSVP tasks closely replicating the methods of Snyder and McLean et al. In Experiment 2, we closely equated the two tasks as far as possible while maintaining the crucial space/time difference. Consistent with the previous studies, and reflecting binding errors (or slippage) in both space and time, erroneously reported identities were predominantly from items adjacent to the targets. Correlations between measures of the slippage in space (visual search) and time (RSVP) were near zero, suggesting that different attentional ‘beams’ bind features in space and time, a possibility that is consistent with other behavioural as well as neuropsychological evidence.},
